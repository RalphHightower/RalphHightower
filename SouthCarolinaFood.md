[^11]: The Shrimp and Grits is excellent. Get their she-crab soup also.
[^12]: They are the standard that I measure all sushi üç£  places by.
[^13]: Hamburgers are their specialty. They have fourteen different toppings for their burgers 
[^14]: It is my executive decision to make exceptions for franchises and multi-store locations because of the quality of their food.
[^15]: You don't go to a renowned steak house for fish or chicken!
[^16]: Villa Tronco is the oldest Italian restaurant in South Carolina. Their restaurant provided "comfort food" for Italian-Americans Army recruits training at Camp Jackson during WW II.
