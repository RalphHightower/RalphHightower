[^11]: Since I have had more hospitalizations than I wanted, I created this channel guide for myself.
[^12]: None the links to the channel schedules are active yet.
[^13]: [SWANK Patient Network](https://www.swank.com/) supplies [Lexington Medical Center](https://www.lexmed.com/) movies.

## Disclaimer 

***My renaming of Faux News for Fox News, and Crap for RAP, is my personal assessment, and does not reflect on Lexington Medical.***
