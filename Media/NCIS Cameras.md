According to my web search, the camera brands used in different NCIS shows are as follows:

- **NCIS**: The main camera used in this show is **Nikon**¬π. Other cameras that have been used include **Arri Alexa**, **Canon EOS C300**, **GoPro HD Hero 2**, **Panavision Genesis HD Camera**, and **Panavision Panaflex**¬≤.
- **NCIS: New Orleans**: I could not find any specific information about the camera brand used in this show, but it is likely to be similar to the original NCIS series.
- **NCIS: LA**: This show also uses **Nikon** cameras, as seen in some episodes¬≥.
- **NCIS: Hawaii**: This show is a spin-off of NCIS that will premiere in 2024. I do not have any information about the camera brand that will be used in this show yet.
- **NCIS: Sydney**: This show is a proposed spin-off of NCIS that is in development. I do not have any information about the camera brand that will be used in this show yet.

As for Hawaii 5-0 and Magnum PI, these shows have had a crossover event in 2020, and they both use **Canon** cameras, as well as **Arri Alexa** and **Panavision Primo**‚Å¥‚Åµ‚Å∂.

I hope this answers your question. If you have any follow-up questions or requests, please let me know. üòä
