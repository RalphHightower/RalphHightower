Hi, I’m @RalphHightower.

I freeze time; I photograph. I have 50++ years of computer programming and software development; most recently using C# and .Net. Athough I am retired from software development as a vocation, I am still active for personal projects. I have witnessed two final space flights: the US half of the Apollo/Soyuz Test Project, and Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis with the Final Four [CDR Chris Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandra Magnus,  MS2 Rex Walheim], as well as the final landing next to the control tower of the Shuttle Landing Facility (200 yards from the runway).

Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed almost as long as I've used computers. I started with film photography in 1980 with the Canon A-1. I added one of my bucket list cameras in July 2013 with the Canon New F-1 with the AE Finder FN and the AE Motor Drive FN. December 2013, I added digital to the mix with the Canon 5D Mark III and the Canon EF 24-105mm f4L.

| [Microsoft Copilot Personality Test](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/how-do-you-ai ) | The Storyteller<br />You love to spin a great yarn and are probably guilty of talking a colleague’s ear off on more than one occasion. You might see generative AI as a way to amp up your storytelling or sales pitches, in the form of persuasive emails or pitch decks. It’s possible you’re already using it to brainstorm presentation titles, taglines, or product names. Great!<br /><br />You’ll get even more value out of generative AI if you expand your toolkit beyond creation and into some more nitty-gritty tasks. Copilot can summarize meetings, catch you up on your inbox, and uncover hidden information in an Excel spreadsheet. It can even fix all the mismatching fonts on your presentation. You can also use Copilot for Microsoft 365 to dig through all your emails, documents, messages, and meeting transcripts and track down the numbers you need in just a few seconds. That helps you fact-check yourself on the fly—especially useful if you (like many storytellers!) have a tendency to get carried away. |

[^12]: People with INTP preferences are quiet, thoughtful, and analytical. They tend to put a great deal of consideration into everything they do. INTPs are generally easygoing and genuine. They might seem to “zone out” from time to time while they consider new concepts or explore how something works. They are often happiest laying low and working hard behind the scenes. While they may seem impersonal with people they don’t know well, they like to have a close group of people they open up to. They are naturally adept at building structural models or coming up with new concepts for solving problems. They tend to see the world as a system that can be analyzed, and this is how they approach just about everything in life.<br />• 4.8% of the population • 5.8% of men • 4.0% of women<br /> analytical × conceptual × logical <br /> quiet × independent × easygoing <br /> complex × driven × curious <br /> questioning × methodical × values competence <br /> self-critical × thoughtful × innovative <br /> problem solver × reflective × autonomous 
[^13]: I had to Google the GOT Personality Test. Oh, I don't subscribe to HBO, so all I know of Game of Thrones is that's it's sorta like King Arthur set in medieval times.<br />I took the GOT Personality Test. I saw that reference in a LinkedIn news article about using personality tests to get the right balance of different personalities. I think using a personality test to determine employment is a form of discrimination and I use that rather strictly because there's race discrimination and gender discrimination.
[^14]: Primary Character: Mance Rayder <br />Nickname: King Beyond the Wall<br />Traits: Inspiring, Formidable, Pioneer<br />Your primary character is Mance Rayder. You are a charismatic, calm, and determined man with strong leadership qualities. You tend to rise quickly through the ranks of any organization you enter. You have good social and diplomatic skills, allowing you to collaborate with many different types of people. You have an honest yet stern persona which earns you respect and admiration of those around you. You are very trusting which can be your greatest weakness. You value freedom above all else.
[^15]: Secondary Character: Ser Jaime Lannister<br />Nickname: The Kingslayer<br />Traits: Arrogant, Sarcastic, Apathetic<br />Your secondary character is Ser Jaime Lannister. You are charming and capable of impeccable politeness in the right circumstances. In the wrong circumstances, others perceive you to be disdainful, sarcastic and arrogant. However your arrogance may just be confidence, as you excel in a number of areas, including intelligence. You don't mock others over minor failings but you are usually very blunt. You typically just say what you are thinking without regard to the feelings of those that you perceive as incompetent. You regard ruthlessness as a virtue and behave in an unapologetically amoral way. You're not politically ambitious and sly maneuvering is not your way.
[^16]: Tertiary Character: Ygritte<br />Nickname: Ygritte<br />Traits: Wild, Uncoventional, Determined<br />Your tertiary character is Ygritte. You are brave and unconventional. You have a mind of your own and prefer not to conform with the demands of societu're cunning and value freedom above all else. You're loyal, but also very passionate and you follow to your heart much more than your head. You live a very fulfilled life, chasing your dreams but this sometimes causes others to mistrust you although you have little enmity in your heart.

## Bucket Lists

I, along with a few other coworkers, were huddled around a portable B&W TV on April 12, 1981 to watch NASA's Space Shuttle Columbia make her maiden voyage. It was then that I, as a 20-something, put seeing a Space Shuttle launch in person on my bucket list. After that was checked ✔️ off, I thought "What's next?", so I added more items.

[^81]: From April 12, 1981, when I saw Space Shuttle Columbia make her maiden voyage, I said to myself, "I gotta see a launch in person!"
[^82]: This was totally unexpected, getting an invitation to see Space Shuttle Atlantis land in person next to to control tower for the Shuttle Landing Facility, just 200 yards from the runway. Atlantis landed in the pre-dawn hour.
[^83]: After checking off the only item on my 30 year old bucket list, I thought "What's next?" Okay, what about The Masters? The first time in the ticket lottery in 2014,I got the opportunity to buy tickets. I chose a practice round day, Monday, so I could bring my camera. During tournament days, only the news media is allowed cameras. Unfortunately, as we were driving to Augusta on I-20, it was raining and got so bad with lightning that Augusta National had to cancel Monday's practice. Augusta National guaranteed that everyone that bought 2014 tickets could buy tickets for 2015. We chose a Wednesday for the reason of bringing my own cameras. I brought my Canon New F-1 with the FD 28mm f2.8 loaded with Fuji slide film for the scenics, and Mt Canon EOS 5D III with the EF 100-400mm f4-5.6L (rented) for the action. Augusta National does not have any lens length restrictions, but PGA events has a rule that no lenses can be longer than six inches. Check the course event's web page for any restrictions. 
[^84]: Two cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. The NSF determined in November 2020 that it was safer to decommission the telescope rather than to try to repair it, but the telescope collapsed before a controlled demolition could be carried out. The remaining support cables from one tower failed around 7:56 a.m. local time on December 1, 2020, causing the receiver platform to fall into the dish and collapsing the telescope.
[^85]: As a teenager, unaware of bucket lists, I have coveted the [Chevy](https://www.chevrolet.com/) [Corvette](https://www.chevrolet.com/performance/corvette) ever since 1968, when the Corvette got its current styling; so, technically, the Corvette could be considered my firt bucket list item. Sure, the body styles have changed, but the basic bones, that signature look, has had small variations. 
[^86]: This was the third car in high school. I drove this through college. It had an I-6 with a three speed manual transmission. Later while I was at [NCR](https://www.ncr.com/) E&M-Columbia, I bought a 1965 that had a V-8 and three speed manual. We have also owned newer models.
[^87]: This was my second car in high school. It had an I-6 with a four speed manual transmission. I don't remember why it was replaced, but it wasn't wrecked. 
[^88]: Paula totaled mine 2023-01-26. Damn it! I loved the retro styling and with the rear seats down, it had enough cargo capacity for our household of two and two Beagles. We took a week-long trip to Florida with three Beagles. We had to "tetris-pack", but it worked. 
[^89]:  This was my first car as teen driver. It had an I-6 and a 3 speed manual transmission.
[^90]: July 2013, my wife and I were traveling back home from Charleston, South Carolina. I mentioned to her *"[KEH](https://www.keh.com/) has a [Canon](https://www.usa.canon.com/) [New F-1](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film105.html) with the AE Motor Drive FN and AE Finder FN for sale."* She asked *"Is that their flagship camera?"* I answered *"Yes, for the 80's."* She said *"Buy it."*
[^91]: I love the instruction set of this magnificent beast of a computer. 
[^92]: It's gotta have the blinking console lights and console switches.
[^93]: Cray Computers can, besides a supercomputer, be considered works of art.
[^94]: First experience programming computers 
[^95]: Once she has external tank and dummy solid rocket boosters attached, displayed upright as if ready for launch.

## Interests 

As an INTP on the Myers-Briggs Personality Assessment, my career in software development was a natural match; I have enjoyed computer programming and software development since my introduction to computer programming in my first engineering class at the University of South Carolina College of Engineering. Our class chose to use the department's Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer programming in FOCAL (similar to Dartmouth BASIC). In the next class, we learned to program using the PDP-8 assembly language; which provided the basis for learning other computers instruction sets: Intel 8080/8085, DEC PDP-8 and PDP-11, Motorola 68000, and IBM 360/370. Computer high-level languages: C, C++, C# & .Net, Fortran IV, Java, PL/1, SNOBOL, Algol, Pascal, Visual Basic, Dartmouth BASIC, APL, and Delphi. Operating Systems: Windows, Unix, and Linux. Web markup languages: HTML, JavaScript, and XML.

### Photography 

Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed almost as long as I've used computers. My first 35mm SLR is the Canon A-1, which I still own and use is the Canon A-1, an innovative camera in 1980 with its shutter priority, aperture priority, program, stoped-down metering, and manual control; I added a few accessories, and a few lenses. I added digital to the mix with the Canon 5D Mark III and the Canon EF 24-105mm f4L.

My Y2K12 project: Photograph the year exclusively using B&W film. I rediscovered the classic look of B&W film when I photographed the final Space Shuttle landing. Since it was a pre-dawn landing, color would have been wasted. For that year, I had two photography projects:
1) Photograph the sunrise over Columbia, South Carolina from the Lake Murray dam on the equinoxes and solstices;
2) Photograph the full moon rising and setting (started in February and carried over to January).

### Software Development

In between my employment at NCR E&M-Columbia and SC DHEC, I had a brief tour of duty at Policy Management System (Stock Symbol: PMS). This was during the time when they were fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission because its executive and senior management booked revenue on December 32<sup>nd</sup>. I have also worked for a few DOT-COM'S 🎆 that became DOT-BOMB'S 💣 .

- Affinity Technology Group (Stock Symbol: AFFI)
- HealthMagic
- Global Health Technology (bought by CBSI aka Covansys)

As a Software Developer at the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, I developed web applications using C# and .Net using Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB/2 databases. I have also written Windows services to monitor the health of web applications, their associated databases, SSL certificate expiration and network connectivity to alert the appropriate teams.
Besides developing Windows services to monitor web applications and their associated databases, I have developed services to extract data for SFTP file exports on a monthly basis, update SCSERV hospitals and clinics in Microsoft SQL Server with reference data from the EFIS Oracle database.

One large scale Windows application that I developed using C# and .Net for my personal use read the NASA mission schedules for the Space Shuttle missions that they published as Excel spreadsheets and created events in the calendar of Microsoft Outlook using Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office. I thought that others would be interested in using the application also, so I published the installation executable with the source code on  Microsoft’s now decommissioned source code publishing site, Codeplex; I migrated it over to GitHub although support of the application officially ended with wheelstop of Atlantis on mission STS-135 with the Final Four, CDR Chris Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandy Magnus, and MS2 Rex Walheim. 

### NASA Spaceflight 

On [July 8, 2011, I was able to check off a 30 year old bucket list item: witness a Space Shuttle launch in person.](https://flic.kr/s/aHsjvNsNvU). I also had the opportunity that few people have seen; I, as well as forty-nine other people by the Shuttle Landing Facility Control Tower, [got to see Atlantis land for the final time on July 21, 2011](https://flic.kr/s/aHsjvNti8h). I have witnessed two final manned spaceflights in person, Atlantis and the US half of Apollo/Soyuz Test Project on July 15, 1975. Atlantis was the second final manned spaceflight that I witnessed in person.

Watching the Space Shuttle land on television, the twin sonic booms sound like a muffled *boom.boom.* In person, the twin sonic booms that Space Shuttles announce that they are returning home is loud, sharp, and crisp: **BANG! BANG!**

## Obsolete Computer Collection 

My wife bought me a Sun SparcStation IPX at a company salvage sale so I  could keep my UNIX skills active. I had Apache Web Server with OpenSSL installed from source code, and OpenLDAP also installed from source code using gcc.
I installed Apache web server installed on my Windows NT Workstation as a proxy server so the SparcStation and Linux server could share internet access, first using dial-up and later with cable.

A technology company had shut down and one of the Affinity Technology Group former coworkers rescued a DEC VAXStation II/GPX from being trashed. He was moving from South Carolina to Washington (home of Microsoft) and he was going to toss it in the dumpster. He asked if I wanted it. "Sure!" That is a heavy sucka!

## HP (Hewlett-Packard) Calculators[^41]

[^41]: HP said in their print advertisements *"HP has no equal."*<br />What can I say? I've been a big fan of HP Calculators ever since they introduced the HP-35. I finally managed to buy an HP-45. I use the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). I cannot use an algebraic calculator. I bought my wife an HP-16C in 1988 since I couldn't use her algebraic calculator to balance our checkbook. The HP-16C still works to this day.

## [Beagles](Beagles/Beagles.md)

Paula and I have had and raised Beagles since 1979 when someone dropped a Beagle off in our
neighborhood, who we named Sport. We have put the obedience title, Companion Dog (CD) on Ranger and 
Runner. We got Writer and Rebecca from conformation breeder and they have earned Championships along
with the CD obedience titles.

We have bred and raised a few litters.

I enjoy water-skiing. I learned on Lake Greenwood, South Carolina. I consider Lake Murray, 
South Carolina to be my "home lake" since I live nearby. My wife, Paula, and I would camp
at Hamilton Branch State Park on Clark Hill Lake, South Carolina and Georgia.

Bodies of Water That I Have Skiied:
- South Carolina Lakes 
   - Lake Greenwood
   - Lake Murray
   - Clark Hill Lake
- Midwestern Rivers
   - Cedar River (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)
   - Mississippi River (between the Quad Cities of Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline, Illinois)

## Preferred Photography Vendors 

I have bought new and used equipment from [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/)[^62] and used equipment from [KEH](https://www.keh.com/)[^61], including a complete Canon New F-1 system. [KEH](https://www.keh.com/) also does camera repairs. I have rented lenses from [lensrentals.com](https://www.lensrentals.com/)[^63] for use at The Masters and for the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse. 

| [About KEH](https://www.keh.com/)[^61] |

| KEH has always envisioned a better way to put rare and quality secondhand cameras in the hands of fellow photographers. With your support, we’ve become the largest curated market for used (or, in our view, field-tested) photo and video equipment in the industry. |
| In an age that treats every camera like a disposable camera and every photo like an instant photo, we believe in making the best last. Gear that earns the KEH stamp of approval is gear that goes further and reaches higher. Graded by experts. Renewed with care. One-of-a-kind. Sustainable. Exchangeable. |
| A KEH camera is an instrument of possibility. In your hands, that secondhand camera instantly becomes something new:
An opportunity. A chance to create and share something extraordinary with the world. |
| A camera is what you make of it. We can’t wait to see what develops. |

| We hire and extensively train our product specialists so that each one can speak from a place of confidence and expertise... which means when you need answers, we're ready with solutions, tailored to you. |

Choose from 11+ football fields' worth of leading-edge technology plus hard-to-find rarities. You might even find a bona fide electronics collectible in our Used Department! |
