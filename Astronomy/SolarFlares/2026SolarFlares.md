| **[Another STRONG X1.5 Flare from Solar Region 4366 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/another-strong-x15-flare-solar-region-4366)** <br />Solar active region 4366 continues to release strong solar flares, the latest was an X1.5 today at 1418 UTC. Since this region emerged on Jan 30, it already produced 21 C-class, 38 M-class and 5 X-class flares, including an X8.1 on Feb 01 that was accompanied by a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that may cause glancing influences near Earth on Feb 05-06. SWPC forecasters continue to monitor the Region 4366 closely. | **Tuesday, February 03, 2026 16:11 UTC** |
| **[NASA's IMAP Active Link for Real-Time Data now Available / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/nasas-imap-active-link-real-time-data-now-available)** <br />After launching on September 24, 2025, NASA’s Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) observatory recently entered orbit around the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point. In addition to new heliophysics science observations, five in-situ instruments on IMAP make measurements that are critical for advancing space weather research and operational forecasting. These measurements are continuously telemetered in near real-time as part of the low-latency IMAP Active Link for Real-Time (I-ALiRT) space weather data stream. The I-ALiRT data set includes ACE-heritage products at higher measurement cadences and also new data products that are available for the first time as part of the near real-time space weather data pipeline. These new products include high-energy electron count rates, helium ion count rates, solar wind charge state ratios and elemental abundances, and counterstreaming electron flow information. NOAA/Space Weather Prediction Center forecasters look forward to having access to the I-ALiRT data sets from IMAP to improve timeliness of energetic particle event warnings, alerts, and forecasts.<br /><br /><br />For more information about I-ALiRT, including access to the quick look plots and data files, please visit [https://imap-mission.com/ialirt](https://imap-mission.com/ialirt) (link is external).

Potential effects are mainly restricted to aviation polar routes, high frequency (HF) radio communications in polar regions. | **Monday, January 19, 2026 18:54 UTC** |
| **[G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Watch for 20 January UTC-Day / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-watch-20-january-utc-day)** <br />A G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for the 20 January UTC-day due to Earth-arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME blasted from the Sun on 18 Jan, in association with an energetic R3 (Strong) solar flare from a sunspot region near center-disk, and is anticipated to arrive at Earth as early as late 19 Jan EST to early 20 Jan. While the G4 Watch is out for the 20 Jan UTC-day, geomagnetic storm levels could range from G1-G3 (Minor-Moderate) upon CME arrival later on 19 Jan EST. CME passage is expected to continue through 20 Jan, but conditions are likely to weaken later in the day. G1 levels remain possible on 21 Jan due to residual CME related effects. Forecasters have a fair measure of confidence in timing and of CME arrival at Earth.

| **[Who’s That Photobombing the Sun? / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/who%E2%80%99s-photobombing-sun)** <br />While they might look like stars, the bright spots in the latest coronagraph imagery are actually the planets Mercury, Venus, and Mars passing behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective. To see them, we use a specialized telescope called a coronagraph, which utilizes an internal occulting disk to block out the Sun’s direct glare. This allows us to observe the much fainter solar corona. | **Thursday, January 15, 2026 20:11 UTC** |
