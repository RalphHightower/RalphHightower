### Solar Activity — 2026

| Solar Event | Date |
|---|---|
| **[G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Levels Reached 19 Jan, 2026 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)** <br />G4 Levels were first reached at 2:38pm EST (1938 UTC) on 19 January, 2026 upon CME shock arrival. CME passage is expected to continue through the evening with G4 levels remaining possible. | **Monday, January 19, 2026 20:09 UTC** |
| **[S4 (Severe) Solar Radiation Storm in Progress, January 19th, 2026 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/s4-severe-solar-radiation-storm-progress-january-19th-2026)** <br />An S4 (Severe) solar radiation storm is in progress.<br /><br />▪︎ NOAA’s GOES-19 satellite measurements show the ongoing solar radiation storm has intensified to Severe (S4) on the NOAA Space Weather Scales, and it is **still increasing**.<br /><br />▪︎ A Severe (S4) radiation storm is a rare event and exceeds the intensity during the October 2003 “Halloween” space weather storms.<br /><br />▪︎ Potential Impacts:<br /><br />• Increased radiation exposure risk for astronauts and flights on polar routes.<br /><br />• Enhanced risk to satellites, especially those in geostationary orbit, and space launch systems.<br /><br />• Loss of over-the-horizon high-frequency communications in polar regions.<br /><br />SWPC has notified airlines, FAA, NASA, FEMA, NERC, and other stakeholders to support preparedness actions as conditions evolve.<br /><br /><br />This significant level has not been observed since October, 2003. Potential effects are mainly restricted to aviation polar routes, high frequency (HF) radio communications in polar regions. | **Monday, January 19, 2026 18:54 UTC** |
| **[G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Watch for 20 January UTC-Day / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-watch-20-january-utc-day)** <br />A G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for the 20 January UTC-day due to Earth-arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME blasted from the Sun on 18 Jan, in association with an energetic R3 (Strong) solar flare from a sunspot region near center-disk, and is anticipated to arrive at Earth as early as late 19 Jan EST to early 20 Jan. While the G4 Watch is out for the 20 Jan UTC-day, geomagnetic storm levels could range from G1-G3 (Minor-Moderate) upon CME arrival later on 19 Jan EST. CME passage is expected to continue through 20 Jan, but conditions are likely to weaken later in the day. G1 levels remain possible on 21 Jan due to residual CME related effects. Forecasters have a fair measure of confidence in timing and of CME arrival at Earth.

| **[X-class Flare Activity Observed - 18 January 2026 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/x-class-flare-activity-observed-18-january-2026)** <br />Region 4341 produced an X1.9/3b flare (R3-Strong) at 18/1809 UTC. | **Sunday, January 18, 2026 18:29 UTC** |
| **[Who’s That Photobombing the Sun? / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/who%E2%80%99s-photobombing-sun)** <br />While they might look like stars, the bright spots in the latest coronagraph imagery are actually the planets Mercury, Venus, and Mars passing behind the Sun from Earth’s perspective. To see them, we use a specialized telescope called a coronagraph, which utilizes an internal occulting disk to block out the Sun’s direct glare. This allows us to observe the much fainter solar corona. | **Thursday, January 15, 2026 20:11 UTC** |
| [CCOR-1 Differential Images Now Available on the SWPC Webpage / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/ccor-1-differential-images-now-available-swpc-webpage)<br />Differential imagery animations are now available on our SWPC webpage. Access by navigating to the coronagraph imagery as noted in the included graphic. | Tuesday, January 06, 2026 21:17 UTC |
| [NOAA SWFO-L1 Update as of January 5th, 2026 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/noaa-swfo-l1-update-january-5th-2026)<br />The NOAA SWFO-L1 spacecraft is approaching its orbital insertion day of January 20, 2026. Instrumentation and data continue to be evaluated and thus far, systems are still performing as expected. The compact coronagraph (CCOR-2) is planned for first door opening on January 21st, which will set the stage for this instrument's performance and imagery to be evaluated.  Overall consensus from system engineers is that things are still looking great for SWFO-L1. | Tuesday, January 06, 2026 17:38 UTC |
