Instrumentation and data continue to be evaluated and thus far, systems are still performing as expected. The compact coronagraph (CCOR-2) is planned for first door opening on January 21st, which will set the stage for this instrument's performance and imagery to be evaluated.  Overall consensus from system engineers is that things are still looking great for SWFO-L1. | Tuesday, January 06, 2026 17:38 UTC |
