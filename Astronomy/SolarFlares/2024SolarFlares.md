### Solar Activity — 2024

| Solar Event | Date |
|---|---|
| **[S3 (Strong) Solar Radiation Storm in Progress / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/s3-strong-solar-radiation-storm-progress)** <br />S3 (Strong) solar radiation storm conditions were reached the morning of 9 October (Eastern time zone). Storm conditions of at least S1-S2 (Minor-Moderate) are likely to continue into 10-11 October. This event is associated with the X1.8 (R3) solar flare the evening of 8 October and its related coronal mass ejection (CME). Visit our webpage for the latest information and updates about this event. | **Wednesday, October 09, 2024 13:58 UTC** |
| **[G4 (Severe) Storm Watch for 10-11 October / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october)** <br />A fast coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun the evening of 8 October, 2024, and is likely to arrive at Earth on 10 October. This CME has been analyzed and speed estimates are 1200 to 1300 km/s. This makes for a potential arrival time as early as the morning to midday of 10 October EDT. There is potential to reach G4 (Severe) upon arrival of this CME and throughout its passage. We won’t know the characteristics of the CME until it arrives 1 million miles from Earth and its speed and magnetic intensity are measured by the DSCOVR and ACE satellites. Please visit our webpage for the latest information and updates. | **Wednesday, October 09, 2024 14:44 UTC** |
| **[R3 (Strong) HF Radio Blackout Event / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/r3-strong-hf-radio-blackout-event)** <br />An X1.8 flare was observed at 09/0156 UTC from Region 3848. Stay tuned for updates! | **Wednesday, October 09, 2024 02:28 UTC** |
| **[Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS Comes into View of Coronagraph Imagery / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-comes-view-coronagraph-imagery)** <br />Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) came into view of the NASA/SOHO Coronagraph on 7 October. The comet's appearance coincided with an X2.1 (R3-Strong) flare and a pair of coronal mass ejections (CME). The comet will continue to pass from the right to the top left of the Sun into October 10th before it moves out of view by October 11th. During its transit across the coronagraph imager, it will continue to be a magnificent presence, but could over-saturate imagery due to its tremendous brightness.

| **[Sun Releases Strong Solar Flare – Solar Cycle 25 • NASA](https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2024/08/14/sun-releases-strong-solar-flare-14/)** <br /><br />The Sun emitted a strong solar flare, peaking at 2:40 a.m. ET on Aug. 14, 2024. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun constantly, captured an image of the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.<br /><br />This flare is classified as an X1.1 flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.<br /><br />To see how such space weather may affect Earth, please visit NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center https://swpc.noaa.gov/, the U.S. government’s official source for space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, and alerts. NASA works as a research arm of the nation’s space weather effort.

The CMEs reached Earth over the weekend (August 11-12). CMEs, which are massive eruptions of solar material, can trigger geomagnetic storms upon arrival at Earth, potentially impacting various technologies. Geomagnetic storm conditions steadily intensified throughout the weekend into early Monday, culminating in a G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm shortly before 1500 UTC. The SWPC has maintained continuous communication with power grid reliability coordination centers. This level of storming also causes HF communications degradation at high latitudes and increased satellite drag in low Earth orbit. Conditions are expected to persist into Tuesday, but the duration of CME impacts and the favorability of solar wind conditions remain highly uncertain. These conditions are part of the ongoing Solar Cycle 25, which has reached one of its highest levels of sunspot activity in over 20 years.

Solar activity was elevated through the weekend and various eccvents, including solar flares and filament eruptions were associated with CMEs. Some of these CMEs were determined to have Earth-directed components and arrival could begin as early as July 29th due to an event early on 27 July. Additional CMEs recently departed the Sun and are expected to arrive July 30th and continue into July 31st. Any CME arrival on 29 July could result in G1 (Minor) storm levels, however, the brunt of the activity is most likely on 30 July when additional CMEs from 27-28 July arrive and this could lead to G2-G3 levels as indicated by the WSA-Enlil model. CME influences will likely continue into 31 July as it takes time for CMEs to progress over and past Earth. Still, additional CMEs continue to erupt from the Sun due to the number of active regions and the associated complex sunspot groups, and additional CME arrivals are possible. Flare probabilities have increased and M-class flares (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) events are now expected through most of the week, with a slight chance to chance of X-class activity (R3; Strong).

The region produced several solar flares and Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which led to the onset of extreme geomagnetic storming conditions; the strongest since the Halloween Solar Storms of 2003. These storms caused widespread auroras, disruptions in satellite operations and communications, potential power grid issues, and increased radiation hazards for space missions and high-altitude flights. Active Region 13664 returned twice, renumbered as Active Region 13697, which produced the largest proton event of Solar Cycle 25, and again as Active Region 13723.

The increased geomagnetic activity was in response to the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) that departed the Sun on June 25th. The CME was associated with a large filament eruption and analysis indicated a possible Earth arrival as a glancing blow today. Indeed, a disturbance in the solar wind was observed by an observation satellite one million miles from Earth at 5:12am EDT. This was the leading edge of the CME and when it arrived at Earth, geomagnetic conditions quickly intensified and eventually reached G3 levels. The G3 Warning is in effect until 5:00pm EDT as CME passage is anticipated to continue through the day.

NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun constantly, captured images of the events.<br /><br />On the left, a teal Sun against a black background. The Sun has bright spots, especially on the far left and far right, but the brightest spot is slight to the right of center. There there is a bright flash — the flare. On the right, the same Sun, shown in red. The bright flash of the second flare is in the same spot as the first. Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.<br /><br />The first flare is classified as an X1.0 flare and the second flare is classified as an X2.2 flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. | **May 9, 2024** |

| **[Multiple R3 Flares from 5-6 May, 2024 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/multiple-r3-flares-5-6-may-2024)** <br />The Sun unleashed a series of X-class flares (R3; Strong) from 5 to 6 May, 2024. Multiple M-class flares (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) events have also occurred since May 5th. However, intensity of the flares first breached R3 thresholds on May 5th at 2:01 EDT (0601 UTC) with an X1.3 flare. An X1.2 flare occurred later at 7:54am EDT (1154 UTC). The most recent X-class flare reached X4.5 on May 6th at 2:35am EDT (0635 UTC) - the strongest of this series of flares. However, this was not the strongest flare of Solar Cycle 25 thus far - that honor is still held by an X6 flare on February 22nd, 2024. The current source of the strong flare activity is NOAA/SWPC Region 3663, a complex sunspot cluster over the northern solar hemisphere. There remains a continuing likelihood of additional M-class flares, with a good chance of additional X-class flares over the next three days.

| [Total Solar Eclipse Science from the Backyard / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/total-solar-eclipse-science-backyard)<br />The total solar eclipse will be a great time for science from the backyard. During totality, what will the Sun's corona look like? Might there be a coronal mass ejection departing the Sun? Could there be a massive solar prominence suspended above the solar disk? These are some of the things to look for when the Sun is completely eclipsed by the Moon (the only safe time to look at the eclipse is during totality). The total solar eclipse of 2017 revealed the Sun's corona in all its glory as captured in the NOAA/SWPC employee photograph. When their photo was aligned and compared to the NASA/SOHO coronagraph imagery for the same time (with the help of jhelioviewer), the three coronal streamers evident from the spacecraft 1 million miles from Earth were also visible from the surface of Earth at the same time. Science from the backyard! Enjoy the event everyone and most of all, be safe. | Wednesday, April 10, 2024 23:40 UTC |

| **[G3 Watch still valid, but conditions diminishing / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g3-watch-still-valid-conditions-diminishing)** <br />The G3 (Moderate) geomagnetic storm watch, associated with the arrival of the CME that departed the Sun on 23 Mar, remains in effect. However, conditions are showing signs of weakening, lessening the chances for G3 levels to be exceeded. The solar wind environment is still enhanced, and any small adjustment in the magnetic field could bring conditions back to G3 levels. Therefore, forecasters are keeping the G3 watch active until the end of the UT day, then lessening the impacts expected to G1 (Minor) storm levels.

Analysis indicated that at least part of these CMEs could come close enough to Earth to raise geomagnetic storm conditions to the G1-Minor level on 27 Jan. This extends the Watch period from 25 Jan through 27 Jan. As with the previous post, higher storm levels are possible if more of a direct impact and/or stronger connection with Earth's magnetic field lines occurs.

The associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were analyzed and modeled. Results of these analysis show potential impacts at Earth as early as late in the day on 24 Jan, with more likely impacts on 25-26 Jan, 2024. As a result, forecasters currently anticipate G1-Minor geomagnetic storm levels over these three days, with higher storm levels possible if more of a direct impact and/or stronger connection with Earth's magnetic field lines occurs.  Analysis continues on the multitude of CMEs currently aimed at Earth.
