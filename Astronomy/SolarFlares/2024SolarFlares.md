The CMEs reached Earth over the weekend (August 11-12). CMEs, which are massive eruptions of solar material, can trigger geomagnetic storms upon arrival at Earth, potentially impacting various technologies. Geomagnetic storm conditions steadily intensified throughout the weekend into early Monday, culminating in a G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm shortly before 1500 UTC. The SWPC has maintained continuous communication with power grid reliability coordination centers. This level of storming also causes HF communications degradation at high latitudes and increased satellite drag in low Earth orbit. Conditions are expected to persist into Tuesday, but the duration of CME impacts and the favorability of solar wind conditions remain highly uncertain. These conditions are part of the ongoing Solar Cycle 25, which has reached one of its highest levels of sunspot activity in over 20 years.

Solar activity was elevated through the weekend and various eccvents, including solar flares and filament eruptions were associated with CMEs. Some of these CMEs were determined to have Earth-directed components and arrival could begin as early as July 29th due to an event early on 27 July. Additional CMEs recently departed the Sun and are expected to arrive July 30th and continue into July 31st. Any CME arrival on 29 July could result in G1 (Minor) storm levels, however, the brunt of the activity is most likely on 30 July when additional CMEs from 27-28 July arrive and this could lead to G2-G3 levels as indicated by the WSA-Enlil model. CME influences will likely continue into 31 July as it takes time for CMEs to progress over and past Earth. Still, additional CMEs continue to erupt from the Sun due to the number of active regions and the associated complex sunspot groups, and additional CME arrivals are possible. Flare probabilities have increased and M-class flares (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) events are now expected through most of the week, with a slight chance to chance of X-class activity (R3; Strong).

The region produced several solar flares and Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which led to the onset of extreme geomagnetic storming conditions; the strongest since the Halloween Solar Storms of 2003. These storms caused widespread auroras, disruptions in satellite operations and communications, potential power grid issues, and increased radiation hazards for space missions and high-altitude flights. Active Region 13664 returned twice, renumbered as Active Region 13697, which produced the largest proton event of Solar Cycle 25, and again as Active Region 13723.

The increased geomagnetic activity was in response to the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) that departed the Sun on June 25th. The CME was associated with a large filament eruption and analysis indicated a possible Earth arrival as a glancing blow today. Indeed, a disturbance in the solar wind was observed by an observation satellite one million miles from Earth at 5:12am EDT. This was the leading edge of the CME and when it arrived at Earth, geomagnetic conditions quickly intensified and eventually reached G3 levels. The G3 Warning is in effect until 5:00pm EDT as CME passage is anticipated to continue through the day. There will likely be variable conditions of geomagnetic response during CME progression, so continue to monitor our SWPC webpage for the latest information and updates. | **Friday, June 28, 2024 23:25 UTC** |

However, this was not the strongest flare of Solar Cycle 25 thus far - that honor is still held by an X6 flare on February 22nd, 2024. The current source of the strong flare activity is NOAA/SWPC Region 3663, a complex sunspot cluster over the northern solar hemisphere. There remains a continuing likelihood of additional M-class flares, with a good chance of additional X-class flares over the next three days.

| [Total Solar Eclipse Science from the Backyard / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/total-solar-eclipse-science-backyard)<br />The total solar eclipse will be a great time for science from the backyard. During totality, what will the Sun's corona look like? Might there be a coronal mass ejection departing the Sun? Could there be a massive solar prominence suspended above the solar disk? These are some of the things to look for when the Sun is completely eclipsed by the Moon (the only safe time to look at the eclipse is during totality). The total solar eclipse of 2017 revealed the Sun's corona in all its glory as captured in the NOAA/SWPC employee photograph. When their photo was aligned and compared to the NASA/SOHO coronagraph imagery for the same time (with the help of jhelioviewer), the three coronal streamers evident from the spacecraft 1 million miles from Earth were also visible from the surface of Earth at the same time.
