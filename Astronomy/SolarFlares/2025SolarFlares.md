| **[G4 (Severe) Watch in Effect for 12 November / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-watch-effect-12-november)** <br />Geomagnetic Storm Watches in Effect, to include G4 (Severe) potential for 12 November. The current list of Watches include: 11 Nov G2 (Moderate); 12 Nov G4 (Severe); and 13 Nov G3 (Strong). These Watches are in response to potential geomagnetic storm effects related to coronal mass ejections (CME) that have erupted from the Sun over the past several days. These events include CME activity from 9 November through the early morning of 12 November. The most recent CME occurred early on 11 Nov and is the most energetic and fastest of the CMEs. This CME was associated with an X5.1 solar flare (R3; Strong) that peaked at 1004 UTC (5:04 am EST) on 11 Nov. This CME is also associated with a moderate level solar radiation storm (S2) that is currently in progress. The forecast is tough due to this latest CME’s predominant ejecta aimed north and ahead of Earth’s orbit; additionally the previous CMEs are in the mix and anticipated to have some Earth-arrival influences prior to the 12 Nov CME arrival. Confidence in an Earth-component to the most recent CME is high, while timing has a moderate level of certainty. As always with these events, the intensity of the CME will not be know with better certainty until it arrives 1 million miles from Earth and is observed by the solar wind observatories at that location. It is at that point that any needed Warning decisions can be made by SWPC forecasters. So, for now, SWPC believes there is a potential for G4 levels upon CME arrival and/or as the CME passage progresses.

| **[Another X flare from Active Region 4274 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/another-x-flare-active-region-4274)** <br />Deja vu! Exactly 26 hours after Active Region 4274 produced an X1.7 flare, it generated an X1.2 flare (R3-Strong on the NOAA Scales). This flare occurred at 10/0919 UTC and was accompanied by several radio signatures that can indicate different effects, to include HF radio blackouts. As Region 4274 continues to maintain a complex magnetic structure, additional flares are possible for the next 24-48 hours. Stay tuned to our website for updates! | **Thursday, November 13, 2025 02:35 UTC** |
| **[Disturbed Space Weather continues through 10 Nov / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/disturbed-space-weather-continues-through-10-nov)** <br />A fast solar wind stream continues to buffet Earth and another grazing from a 07 Nov CME is expected on 10 Nov.  Minor to Moderate geomagnetic storm periods are expected over the next three days. | **Thursday, November 13, 2025 02:35 UTC** |
| **[Geomagnetic Storm Watches for 11-13 November / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/geomagnetic-storm-watches-11-13-november)** <br />[Coronal Mass Ejections (CME)](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections) are anticipated to impact Earth later on 11 November on into 13 November. Therefore, [geomagnetic storm](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms) Watches have been posted as: G2-Moderate for 11 Nov; G3-Strong for 12 Nov; and G1-Minor for 13 Nov. Analyses of these events continues due to the large range of potential outcomes from these events and how they may interact upon arrival at Earth, therefore, there is a moderate level of uncertainty regarding the forecast. However, there is a fair amount of consensus regarding timing for the most recent, 10 Nov CME. Current forecast reasoning is that the CME from 9 Nov is moving at a much slower speed than the CME from 10 Nov. While, there is uncertainty as to whether the second, faster CME will catch up to the first before any Earth component arrival, there would likely not be too much time in between CME arrivals. Once SWPC forecasters have made a decision on the final, most likely outcome, the forecast will be updated accordingly and the best solution WSA-Enlil model run will be posted.

| **[Another, Faster Moving CME Blasts from the Sun Early on 11 November / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/another-faster-moving-cme-blasts-sun-early-11-november)** <br />An energetic and fast moving CME has blasted from the Sun early on 11 November. SWPC forecasters are evaluating the situation and will make any needed geomagnetic storm watch adjustments soon. There are still two other CMEs that are anticipated to affect Earth - the CMEs from 9 and 10 November. This is making for a very complicated and difficult forecast and SWPC forecasters are hard at work this Veteran’s Day sorting together to create an updated forecast..

| **[G3 and G2 Watches for November 7th and 8th / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g3-and-g2-watches-november-7th-and-8th)** <br />A coronal mass ejection (CME) is still anticipated to impact Earth as early as Thursday evening, 6 November EST. Therefore we have a G3 (Strong) Watch in effect on the 6 and 7 November UTC-days. There is a fair measure of confidence in a Earth-directed aspect to this CME and a moderate level of confidence in timing of the CME arrival - which we anticipate with a range from as early as Thursday evening to Friday morning EST. However, as is usual with these events, we have less confidence in the intensity of the resultant geomagnetic storm upon eventual CME arrival and passage. We have to wait until the CME arrives at the solar wind observatory spacecraft located at Lagrange Point 1 (L1), which is 1 million miles from Earth to actually realize what the intensity of the CME is - this is when we will finally know the true speed, magnetic strength, and magnetic field orientation of the CME. All these factors contribute to any needed Warning decisions. This is why accurate observations from that L1 location are so critical and why a much needed replacement in SWFO-L1 is warranted. The normal order of events for a CME impact at Earth are the arrival of the shock front followed later by the magnetic cloud. CME shock arrival can lead to immediate and sudden escalated geomagnetic responses. After shock passage, the strong magnetic field contained within the CME arrives some time later, that is when geomagnetic activity can increase dramatically if the magnetic field is favorable (aligned opposite Earth’s). The second, slower CME is anticipated to arrive on 8 November and therefore, a G2 (Moderate) Watch is now in effect for that day. Now we continue to await CME arrival at L1, so continue to visit the Nation’s official source for space weather warnings and alerts - NOAA SWPC - for the latest. | **Monday, November 10, 2025 21:25 UTC** |

The spacecraft is the first NOAA satellite designed specifically for and fully dedicated to continuous, operational space weather observations. The SWFO-L1 satellite will monitor the Sun’s outer atmosphere for large eruptions, called coronal mass ejections, and measure the solar wind upstream from Earth with a state-of-the-art suite of instruments and processing system. The data will provide early warnings for destructive space weather events that could impact our technological dependent infrastructure and industries, and will be used by SWPC to notify these sectors with advanced and timely notice.<br /><br />The observatory is expected to reach Lagrange point 1 in January 2026, which is nearly a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. It will complete commissioning in mid-2026 and transition to the satellite’s operational phase. NOAA and NASA have important and complementary responsibilities in the development, testing, launch, and operation of SWFO-L1. | **Monday, November 03, 2025 18:17 UTC** |
| **[Earth Makes Appearances in GOES-19 CCOR-1 Imagery / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/earth-makes-appearances-goes-19-ccor-1-imagery)** <br />CCOR-1 is a unique instrument being the first operational dedicated coronagraph to support space weather forecasting. It is also the first coronagraph to fly in geostationary orbit around Earth, and this leads to a number of unique features to its observations. Other coronagraphs have observed from the Lagrange-1 point, 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth in the direction of the Sun, well beyond the orbit of the Moon. Since CCOR-1 rides on the GOES-19 satellite, well within the Moon’s orbit, the Moon sometimes makes appearances in the field of view. The combined motion of GOES-19 and the Moon can make it seem to have curved or even looping paths. Another consequence of its proximity to Earth is sunlight that is reflected from the Earth’s natural albedo (e.g. clouds, snow, ice, oceans, etc.) can impact CCOR-1 observations. This reflected sunlight, called Earthshine, impacts CCOR-1 observations primarily during sunrise hours and the degree of the impact depends on the time of year. The effects are most pronounced around the equinoxes in March and September and gradually decay into the solstices. During periods around the equinoxes the Earth can block the sun from CCOR-1’s field of view and in difference images CCOR-1 is sensitive enough to show the nighttime city lights on the planet below. And of course, the CCOR-1 will show the usual moving objects in space, such as planets, comets, satellites, and maybe, once in a while, a tiny piece of space debris. There are also static or fixed artifacts, such as the dark “collar” around the base of the occulting disk that can be seen when the background is bright. Scientists are working to mitigate Earthshine. | **Monday, November 03, 2025 17:42 UTC** |

| **[UPGRADE to G4 Watch for 1-2 June / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/upgrade-g4-watch-1-2-june)** <br /> The G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm watch is now in effect for 1 and 2 June. A powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun the evening of 30 May. Confidence in an Earth-directed component is good, but the CME arrival timing is more uncertain due to the current state of the solar wind. It could arrive as early as late morning EDT, to as late as Sunday evening EDT of 1 June. The center of the bulk CME material is anticipated to be just north of Earth, however, Earth will still likely undergo passage of much of the CME material. Arrival will likely lead to immediate geomagnetic disturbances with the potential for G4. Conditions will likely intensify as CME progression continues and G4 levels remain possible on Monday, 2 June. Geomagnetic storm levels will likely begin subsiding by Tuesday, 3 June, with G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) still possible. These watches represent potential based on our best analyses. We will not know the true nature of this CME’s geomagnetic storm potential until the CME arrives at our solar wind observatories located 1 million miles from Earth. Upon arrival at those spacecraft, we will know the magnetic strength and orientation that are very important to what levels and duration of geomagnetic storm conditions are expected to occur and any appropriate warnings may be issued.

| **[G3 Storm Reached on New Year's Day of 2025! / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g3-storm-reached-new-years-day-2025)** <br />The second CME arrived overnight and welcomed New Year’s Day in with a geomagnetic storm! This follow-up CME reached our solar wind spacecraft observatories at about 8:57pm EST on December 31st, 2024. This CME became just as strong as its predecessor, however, this second CME (unlike the first CME) was favorable for escalated geomagnetic disturbances at Earth as it reached nearly 5x normal background of magnetic intensity and the orientation of that field was also pointed opposite Earth’s - making for a very good connection and increased geomagnetic response. When a CME’s magnetic field is orientated southward - opposite Earth’s for prolonged and pronounced periods of time, this intensifies geomagnetic reactions significantly. This is what happened overnight, as our solar wind observatories 1 million miles from Earth measured a strong, southward orientated magnetic field in the CME and it has remained so through its passage thus far. G3 (Strong) levels were first reached January 1st, 2025, at 9:10am EST. However, G1 (Minor) conditions were first alerted for on Dec 31st at 11:58pm EST - just minutes before the new year of 2025. G2 (Moderate) levels were first observed by 5:44am EST on January 1st. Will the CME passage remain strong enough and continue into the evening and night hours on New Year’s night for North America? We cannot say as of yet, as we don’t know the depth of CMEs. Continue to keep informed with the latest forecasts, information, and updates by visiting our SWPC webpage. | **Thursday, January 02, 2025 21:06 UTC** |
| **[G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Alert Threshold Reached at 1241 ET / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-alert-threshold-reached-1241-et)** <br />The G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Alert threshold was reached on January 1st, 2025 at 1241 ET due to continued effects from the CME's that left the Sun on December 29th. Stay tuned for updates! | **Thursday, January 02, 2025 21:05 UTC** |
| **[CME Arrival as Expected on 31 December, 2024 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/cme-arrival-expected-31-december-2024)** <br />The anticipated CME that launched from the Sun on 29 Dec has arrived! SWPC forecast timing was very good as the shock arrival at the leading edge of the coronal mass ejection (CME) arrived at our solar wind observatory - NOAA DSCOVR and NASA ACE by 10:56am EST and reached Earth shortly afterwards. The shock is just leading edge of the CME. As CME progression continues, the main magnetic “cloud” embedded within the CME should arrive and we anticipate G1-G3 potential to continue into the evening and early night hours across the U.S. The orientation of that magnetic field is very important and needs to be southward directed (opposite Earth's magnetic field) for geomagnetic responses to escalate. Unfortunately, we have no way of predicting what that orientation will be, other than monitoring the solar wind observatories a million miles from Earth. Those observations are critical to issuing subsequent warnings. Continue to stay properly informed with the latest information and updates on our webpage. | **Thursday, January 02, 2025 14:34 UTC** |
| **[A New Year's Eve Day Geomagnetic Storm is Anticipated - G3 Watch / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/new-years-eve-day-geomagnetic-storm-anticipated-g3-watch)** <br />A G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for 31 Dec, with a G1 (Minor) watch for 1 Jan. These are in anticipation of a pair of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CME). The G1 Watch for 1 Jan is being considered for upgrade to a G2 Watch. SWPC forecasters have a fair level of confidence in some measure of Earth effectual components and general timing windows of these two particular CMEs, however, as is usual with these events, intensity is less certain. We will not know the true potential of geomagnetic disturbance levels of response until the CME(s) arrive 1 million miles from Earth (when they will be about 30-60 minutes from reaching our planet) and their structure and intensity can be measured by our solar wind observatories - NOAA DSCOVR and NASA ACE spacecraft. Also, neither CME is expected to be a direct hit, which also makes forecast of intensity more difficult. Continue to follow our webpage for the latest forecasts and information. |  **Thursday, January 02, 2025 14:34 UTC** |
| **[Pair of R3 (Strong) HF Radio Blackout Events on 30 Dec, 2024 / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/pair-r3-strong-hf-radio-blackout-events-30-dec-2024)** <br />Two simultaneous, yet separate R3 (Strong) radio blackout events occurred at 30/0414 and 0429 UTC, respectively. The first event, an X1.5 flare, peaked at 30/0414 UTC and originated from  Region 3936 in the NW quadrant of the Sun. The second event, an X1.1 flare, began before the first flare had completely ended, and peaked at 30/0429 UTC. This event originated from Region 3932 in the SW quadrant of the Sun. The associated coronal mass ejection was analyzed and determined to not have an Earth-directed component. Stay tuned to our website for updates. | **Thursday, January 02, 2025 14:34 UTC** |
