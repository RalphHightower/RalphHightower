[^21]: Typically, T CrB is not visible to the naked eye at a magnitude of 10. When it reaches peak brightness, T CrB will be comparable to Polaris, the North Star, which has a magnitude of 2. (The smaller the number, the brighter it is.) It should remain this bright for a few days to a week before vanishing again. When T CrB goes off, it will only be at maximum brightness for half a day before you must wait another 80 years to see it with your naked eyes. So go out and keep an eye on it!
[^22]: This Rho Corona Borealis, not T Corona Borealis. But they are in the same constellation.

## Light Pollution 

As rural areas of Lexington County, South Carolina, become suburban areas, the ability to enjoy the night sky is greatly diminished. Subdivisions in the design phase should be developed to preserve dark skies for stargazing, meteor showers, and viewing the International Space Station. Current subdivision currently in the design, development, and construction phases in Lexington County, South Carolina are producing light pollution that destroy the night sky.

### Light Pollution Remediations
 
#### Lighting Recommendations for New Subdivisions

DarkSky International restores the nighttime environment and protects communities from the harmful effects of light pollution through outreach, advocacy, and conservation.

What is light pollution?
Light pollution is the human-made alteration of outdoor light levels from those occurring naturally.

What are the effects?
Light pollution disrupts wildlife, impacts human health, wastes money and energy, contributes to climate change, and blocks our view of the universe.[^31]

## ISS Sighting Opportunities for South Carolina 

If you can see stars at night, then you can watch the ISS when it flies overhead. The sun reflecting off the solar arrays is what makes it visible. It sort of looks like a fast moving star, faster than a passenger jet, but slower than a meteor.
