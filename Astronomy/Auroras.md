The CMEs reached Earth over the weekend (August 11-12). CMEs, which are massive eruptions of solar material, can trigger geomagnetic storms upon arrival at Earth, potentially impacting various technologies. Geomagnetic storm conditions steadily intensified throughout the weekend into early Monday, culminating in a G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm shortly before 1500 UTC. The SWPC has maintained continuous communication with power grid reliability coordination centers. This level of storming also causes HF communications degradation at high latitudes and increased satellite drag in low Earth orbit. Conditions are expected to persist into Tuesday, but the duration of CME impacts and the favorability of solar wind conditions remain highly uncertain. These conditions are part of the ongoing Solar Cycle 25, which has reached one of its highest levels of sunspot activity in over 20 years.

Solar activity was elevated through the weekend and various eccvents, including solar flares and filament eruptions were associated with CMEs. Some of these CMEs were determined to have Earth-directed components and arrival could begin as early as July 29th due to an event early on 27 July. Additional CMEs recently departed the Sun and are expected to arrive July 30th and continue into July 31st. Any CME arrival on 29 July could result in G1 (Minor) storm levels, however, the brunt of the activity is most likely on 30 July when additional CMEs from 27-28 July arrive and this could lead to G2-G3 levels as indicated by the WSA-Enlil model. CME influences will likely continue into 31 July as it takes time for CMEs to progress over and past Earth. Still, additional CMEs continue to erupt from the Sun due to the number of active regions and the associated complex sunspot groups, and additional CME arrivals are possible. Flare probabilities have increased and M-class flares (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) events are now expected through most of the week, with a slight chance to chance of X-class activity (R3; Strong).

The increased geomagnetic activity was in response to the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) that departed the Sun on June 25th. The CME was associated with a large filament eruption and analysis indicated a possible Earth arrival as a glancing blow today. Indeed, a disturbance in the solar wind was observed by an observation satellite one million miles from Earth at 5:12am EDT. This was the leading edge of the CME and when it arrived at Earth, geomagnetic conditions quickly intensified and eventually reached G3 levels. The G3 Warning is in effect until 5:00pm EDT as CME passage is anticipated to continue through the day. There will likely be variable conditions of geomagnetic response during CME progression, so continue to monitor our SWPC webpage for the latest information and updates. | **Friday, June 28, 2024 23:25 UTC** |

Multiple M-class flares (R1-R2; Minor-Moderate) events have also occurred since May 5th. However, intensity of the flares first breached R3 thresholds on May 5th at 2:01 EDT (0601 UTC) with an X1.3 flare. An X1.2 flare occurred later at 7:54am EDT (1154 UTC). The most recent X-class flare reached X4.5 on May 6th at 2:35am EDT (0635 UTC) - the strongest of this series of flares. However, this was not the strongest flare of Solar Cycle 25 thus far - that honor is still held by an X6 flare on February 22nd, 2024. The current source of the strong flare activity is NOAA/SWPC Region 3663, a complex sunspot cluster over the northern solar hemisphere.

| [Total Solar Eclipse Science from the Backyard / NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/total-solar-eclipse-science-backyard)<br />The total solar eclipse will be a great time for science from the backyard. During totality, what will the Sun's corona look like? Might there be a coronal mass ejection departing the Sun? Could there be a massive solar prominence suspended above the solar disk? These are some of the things to look for when the Sun is completely eclipsed by the Moon (the only safe time to look at the eclipse is during totality). The total solar eclipse of 2017 revealed the Sun's corona in all its glory as captured in the NOAA/SWPC employee photograph. When their photo was aligned and compared to the NASA/SOHO coronagraph imagery for the same time (with the help of jhelioviewer), the three coronal streamers evident from the spacecraft 1 million miles from Earth were also visible from the surface of Earth at the same time.

Analysis indicated that at least part of these CMEs could come close enough to Earth to raise geomagnetic storm conditions to the G1-Minor level on 27 Jan. This extends the Watch period from 25 Jan through 27 Jan. As with the previous post, higher storm levels are possible if more of a direct impact and/or stronger connection with Earth's magnetic field lines occurs.

The associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were analyzed and modeled. Results of these analysis show potential impacts at Earth as early as late in the day on 24 Jan, with more likely impacts on 25-26 Jan, 2024. As a result, forecasters currently anticipate G1-Minor geomagnetic storm levels over these three days, with higher storm levels possible if more of a direct impact and/or stronger connection with Earth's magnetic field lines occurs.  Analysis continues on the multitude of CMEs currently aimed at Earth.

AR 3561 was also flaring around this time, but the greatest contribution likely came from AR 3559. Both regions continue to have the potential to produce additional M-class and greater flares capable of moderate radio blackouts. | Wednesday, January 24, 2024 14:28 UTC |

### Photographing Auroras

An aurora is a natural light display predominantly seen in the polar regions, caused by the interaction between the Earth’s magnetic field and charged particles from the Sun. These particles are carried towards the Earth by the solar wind and are mostly electrons and protons. When these charged particles collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, they excite the atoms, causing them to light up. The auroras occurring around the north pole are known as Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights, while those around the south pole are called Aurora Australis or Southern Lights. These displays can vary in color and complexity, from faint glows to rapidly shifting ribbons of light, depending on the type of gas particles involved and their altitude. This celestial phenomenon is not only a beautiful natural spectacle but also part of the larger space weather system that can affect satellite operations and power grids on Earth.

## Solar Dynamics Observatory News

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a NASA mission launched in February 2010 as part of the Living With a Star (LWS) program, which aims to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. The SDO is equipped with three advanced scientific instruments: the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), which together provide comprehensive measurements of the sun’s interior, atmosphere, magnetic field, and energy output. Operating in a geosynchronous orbit around Earth, the SDO supplies high-resolution images of the Sun in multiple wavelengths, offering unprecedented insights into solar activities such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and their effects on space weather. This continuous stream of data plays a crucial role in improving our understanding of the relationship between the Sun and the Earth’s environment.
