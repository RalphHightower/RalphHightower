## [How to Read the Dune Books in Chronological Order](https://za.ign.com/dune-part-two/176935/lists/how-to-read-the-dune-books-in-chronological-order ) — BY ROSIE KNIGHT 

*Warning: this piece contains spoilers for the Dune book series.*

Ever since Frank Herbert released his seminal sci-fi novel Dune in 1965, readers have been consumed by the expansive and complex political wranglings of his influential stories. While Herbert only wrote six Dune novels while he was alive, since his death, his son Brian Herbert and bestselling author Kevin J. Anderson have authored many new canon Dune stories. In fact, the series is currently at an astounding 23 novels and counting; spanning 15,000 years. If you're wondering where to start and how you're supposed to read them, we're here to help.

| Title/Author(s) |
|---|
| **The Butlerian Jihad by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Despite being written decades after the original Dune, Herbert and Anderson use this prequel — the first in a trilogy — to establish and expand on much of the world building and lore from the original. Chronologically this novel takes place earliest in the Dune canon around 10,000 years before the events of Herbert's original novel. Setting up the feudal and technologically-barren world of the books, this story follows the beginnings of a brutal world-changing war between the last free humans and the artificial intelligence and robotics they created. |
| **The Machine Crusade by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|In the second book in Herbert and Anderson's trilogy, readers get to meet more vital players in the wider world of Dune. As the war rages on, readers spend time with ancestors of House Atreides and House Harkonnen while the humans continue their battle with the evil sentient computer overlord Ominus. Dense worldbuilding and intricate plotting fill the pages of this book which builds on what's come before while setting the stage for an epic final battle. |
| **The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
Set 100 years after the events at the beginning of The Butlerian Jihad, the book finds Ominus' plan for universal domination moving ever closer to success. As the most gruesome era of the war begins, history is made. Ominus' dangerous games push the universe to breaking point as each planet does what it must to survive. Establishing much of the status quo of the original book, this entry vitally introduces the battle ready iteration of the Fremen Paul meets in Dune. |
| **Sisterhood of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|The next chronological step in Herbert and Anderson's trilogies is the "Schools of Dune." After another large time jump—this time 83 years—the story focuses on a burgeoning world without the so-called "thinking machines" and how that impacts the universe. Following disparate characters as they venture around the galaxy, there are important reveals about the growing Butlerian movement, and the dangerous violence that's thrumming across the universe. |
| **Mentats of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|With the thinking machines all but destroyed a school is established to train "Mentats" humans of supreme intelligence who can essentially replace the machines the war demolished. Other academies are being founded too including a new school of the sisterhood on Wallach IX. But within their ranks is a young woman desperate for vengeance who could bring down everything. As the schools battle for survival, so does the universe as the Butlerian fanatics rise. |
| **Navigators of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Continuing the origin of the Bene Gesserit, Mentat and Suk Schools, this final book in this trilogy focuses on the ever-growing threat of the anti-technology forces who were inspired by the Butlerian Jihad. Can reason win out against the ever growing fanaticism spreading across the universe? That's the big question as Herbert and Anderson build on this growing chasm.|
| **House Atreides by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Finally gaining on the original Dune novels, the first book in the Prelude to Dune trilogy takes place just 35 years before they begin. Complex threads come together as we get introductions to some major players like Leto Atredis, Duncan Idaho, Baron Harkonnen, and the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. Political shenanigans are at a high here as games are played, loyalty is sought, and the stage is set for an epic battle that will change the universe.|
| **House Harkonnen by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Continuing the Prelude trilogy this novel continues to establish the drama and scheming that lays the groundwork for the original Dune novels. As Houses Harkonnen and Atredis struggle for power, the Bene Gesserit begin to plot towards their ultimate aim: creating the chosen one known as the Kwisatz Haderach, by introducing Leto to his concubine Jessica. So if you've always wanted to know what led to the events of Herbert's beloved books, here's your answer.|
| **House Corrino by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Topping off the Prelude trilogy is this action-packed novel that centers around Leto, Jessica, and their soon to be born son Paul. As the parents eagerly await their new arrival, the witches of the Bene Gesserit couldn't be more excited as they know their chosen one is on the way. But if you've read the Dune books you'll know they might be less than happy with the result. |
| **Princess of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Telling the stories of the two women in Paul Atredis' life, this companion novel focuses on the wife he was forced to marry, Irulan, and the woman he fell in love with on his adventures, Chani. Their dueling stories drive forward this book that gives an expansive look at the women around Paul and how their lives and experiences led them to him for better or for worse. |
| **The Duke of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|The final new trilogy before we reach Herbert's first Dune novel, the Caldan stories center around Paul's father Leto Atreides and his rise to power in the universe. Through honesty, action, and integrity, Duke Leto finds himself with ever more power and status in the political center of the galaxy, but his new status sets him on a dangerous and ultimately fatal course. |
| **The Lady of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|When Lady Jessica betrayed the Bene Gesserit her life was changed forever, in this book we see how that choice and its fallout changed the shape of the universe. When pitted against the ancient order how can one woman — and her love for her family — ever win? And what lengths will she have to go in order to make the ultimate choice and more pressingly to survive? |
| **The Heir of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|As this trilogy comes to an end it centers on the rise of Paul Atriedes better known to the universe as Muad’Dib. But he has yet to take on that title here and instead must go on a journey to find himself and the strength to lead. If you've made it this far then you're about to be rewarded by reading the original novel that started it all...|
| **Frank Herbert's Dune** |
|The book that sparked it all, Herbert's soft sci-fi introduced readers to House Atreides and their young son Pual as they embark on a quest to control and run the wealthy Spice trade on the arid planet Arrakis. Focusing on the interplanetary politics and expansive planetary landscape of his world, Dune is an exceptionally dense read but it's essential to understand the scope of Herbert's creation. While it was obviously the first published Dune book, since Herbert and Anderson's many prequels, it now hits somewhere in the middle of the reading list. |
| **Paul of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Acting as both a prequel and sequel to Dune, this story follows Paul Atreidis before and after the events of the book. As a young child he's entangled in the dangerous politics of the universe as they prepare for his father's wedding. When we join him after Dune we learn more about his time with the Fremen and his relationship with his lover Chani as the pair build a life together. |
| **Frank Herbert's Dune Messiah** |
|Speaking of Paul Atreidis, he's at the center of Herbert's second book where we join him a decade after becoming Emperor. After taking on the mantle of Messiah to the Fremen Paul has unintentionally inspired another universal Jihad, creating havoc and war across galaxies. Thanks to his visions Paul hopes to change the dire future he's created but it won't be easy. |
| **The Winds of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|With Paul lost in the deserts and thought to be dead this book builds in the time between Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. Catching up with Paul's mother Jessica, her daughter and Emperor Regent Alia, and Duncan Idaho, this is a galaxy spanning adventure that adds context and history to the original writings of Herbert while introducing important lore and worldbuilding. |
| **Frank Herbert's Children of Dune** |
|As the ecological landscape of Arrakis changes drastically so does the shape of the universe. Paul of Atreidis young children Leto and Ghanima deal with his legacy in Herbert's third book as they battle against their fates and wonder whether they'll end up just like their dad. The Spice trade comes under threat from an unexpected source and a new leader emerges. |
| **Frank Herbert's God-Emperor of Dune** |
|After the shocking events of the last book we join Leto 3500 years later. How is he almost 4000 years old? Well he merged with a Sandworm in Children of Dune and has since been ruling the universe with an iron fist and brutal regime. This novel follows Leto and inspects his impact on the cosmos as he attempts to keep his rule and hold on the Spice trade no matter what. |
| **Frank Herbert's Heretics of Dune** |
|Get ready for another time jump! This time we're visiting Arrakis 1500 years after the death of God Emperor Leto. Humanity is burgeoning once again and Sandworms have made a resurgence. Three new civilisations reign, including the Bene Gesserit who are struck with a near impossible choice: keep their behind the scenes role as master manipulators of the universe or become true leaders to make the most of the power vacuum in the universe. |
| **Frank Herbert's Chapterhouse: Dune** |
|Finding themselves in a brutal battle with another Matriarchal organization, the Honored Matres, the Bene Gesserit become entangled in a war for survival against their violent foes. This was Herbert's final book and ends on a famous cliffhanger which he was never able to resolve as he died after its publication. But his son and collaborator Anderson would later continue the story. |
| **Hunters of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|The first of a duology that adapts notes left by Herbert for what was planned for Dune 7. Continuing the story from Herbert's books this title explores the fallout from the war between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, as well as the return of the many, many descendants of the humans who were scattered across the universe during the reign of God Emperor Leto.|
| **Sandworms of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Filled with clones, shocking returns, and a huge reveal about the antagonists of the series, this is an event level book that brings together the many loose threads left by the original books. Combining a complex structure, multiple character arcs, and an epic final battle this is a true climax to the overarching Dune series, which has been evolving and growing since 1967.|

## Dune by Frank Herbert 

| *"RalphHightower"* / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|----|
| *"Can you describe Dune to me?"* |
| Sure! Dune is a science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, published in 1965. It is set in the distant future and depicts a feudal society on the planet Arrakis, a desert planet home to the valuable resource known as "spice." The story follows the journey of a young man named Paul Atreides, who becomes embroiled in a power struggle for control of Arrakis and its spice. Along the way, Paul discovers that he possesses special powers and is destined to become a leader in the fight for control of the spice. Dune is a complex and detailed work that explores themes of politics, religion, and the human condition. It is widely regarded as a classic of science fiction and has inspired numerous adaptations in various media. |
| *"Why do different factions want to control the spice?"*|
| In the world of Dune, the spice melange is a valuable and highly sought-after resource that is only found on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. It is a rare and valuable substance that has many uses, including as a spice for food, as a medicine, and as a psychoactive drug that enhances mental abilities. The spice is also used to help fold space, which allows for faster-than-light travel between the stars. As a result, control of the spice is highly coveted by the various factions in the Dune universe. In the novel, the noble House Atreides is given control of Arrakis by the ruling emperor, but they are betrayed by their rivals and a power struggle ensues as various factions vie for control of the spice. |
| *"Who are the Bene Gesserit?"*|
| The Bene Gesserit are a powerful and secretive organization in the Dune universe. They are an all-female group that has been around for thousands of years and has a long tradition of training their members in physical and mental disciplines, as well as genetic manipulation. The Bene Gesserit use their skills and knowledge to gain power and influence, and they often operate behind the scenes, manipulating events to their advantage. They are known for their ability to control their own bodies and emotions, and for their use of a specialized form of communication called "Voice," which allows them to influence and control others through speech and persuasion. The Bene Gesserit are highly respected and feared, and they play a significant role in the events of the Dune novels. |
| *"And the Spacing Guild?"*|
| The Spacing Guild is another important organization in the Dune universe. It is a group of powerful and influential people who control the means of interstellar travel, making them an essential part of the economy and politics of the known universe. The Guild is known for its use of Guild Navigators, who are humans that have been genetically altered and trained to navigate space using the spice melange, which allows them to fold space and travel vast distances in a short amount of time. The Navigators are able to achieve this feat by using their heightened mental abilities and by remaining in a tank of melange gas, which helps them to "see" the folds of space. The Guild is a powerful and mysterious organization that wields significant influence in the world of Dune. |
| *"How do the sandworms factor in Arrakis?"*|
| The sandworms of Arrakis, also known as Dune, are giant, ferocious creatures that live in the desert sands of the planet. They are native to Arrakis and are a central part of the ecosystem there. The sandworms are sensitive to vibrations and are attracted to sounds, and they are known to attack and consume anything that disturbs them. The sandworms are also the source of the spice melange, which is produced in their bodies and released onto the surface of the planet when they die. As a result, the sandworms are highly valuable and are closely guarded by the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen. In the Dune novels, the sandworms play a significant role in the story and are an important part of the culture and economy of Arrakis. |
| *"What about the House of Atreides?"*|
| The House of Atreides is a noble family in the Dune universe. They are descended from the royal line of the planet Caladan and are known for their wisdom, strength, and honor. The Atreides family is led by Duke Leto Atreides, who is a just and fair ruler and is respected by his subjects. The Atreides are also known for their fierce loyalty to their family and to their allies. In the Dune novel, the Atreides family is given control of the planet Arrakis by the ruling emperor, but they are betrayed by their rivals and a power struggle ensues as various factions vie for control of the valuable spice that is produced on Arrakis. The story follows the journey of Duke Leto's son, Paul Atreides, as he becomes embroiled in the conflict and ultimately rises to power as the leader of the Fremen, the native population of Arrakis. | 
| *"Who are the Harkonnen?"*|
| The Harkonnen family is a noble house in the Dune universe. They are depicted as cruel, ruthless, and power-hungry, and are the main antagonists in the Dune novel. The Harkonnen are the sworn enemies of the Atreides family and will stop at nothing to destroy them and gain control of the valuable spice that is produced on the planet Arrakis. The Harkonnens are known for their brutal tactics and are feared throughout the universe. They are led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who is a cruel and sadistic man who takes pleasure in causing pain and suffering. The Harkonnens play a significant role in the Dune novel and are an important part of the story. |
| *"How are sandworms detected?"*|
| Sandworms on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, are difficult to detect because they live deep beneath the sand and are sensitive to vibrations and sounds. They are attracted to anything that disturbs them and will emerge from the sand to attack and consume it. To avoid attracting the attention of sandworms, the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen, have developed special techniques for detecting and avoiding them. One method is the use of "thumper" devices, which are large, mechanical drums that are used to create vibrations in the sand. By creating a rhythmic pattern of vibrations, the Fremen are able to communicate with each other and to attract sandworms to a specific location, where they can be harvested for their spice. The Fremen are also trained to recognize the signs of sandworm activity, such as the appearance of "worm tracks" on the surface of the sand. |
