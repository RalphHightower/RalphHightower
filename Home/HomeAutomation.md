# Home Automation 

I have not decided on which home automation system that I want to deploy, but my decision will be based on versatility. 

## WARNING — DO NO USE CHAMBERLAIN GARAGE DOOR OPENERS!!!

They prohibit the integration of HomeAssistance, and probably other home automation systems like esphome, to interface with their garage door opening systems.
