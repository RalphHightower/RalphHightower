# Home \| Home Automation 

I have not decided on which home automation system that I want to deploy, but my decision will be based on versatility. 

## WARNING — DO NO BUY [CHAMBERLAIN](https://www.chamberlain.com/) OR [LIFTMASTER](https://www.liftmaster.com/) GARAGE DOOR OPENERS!!!

They prohibit the integration of HomeAssistance, and probably other home automation systems like esphome, to interface with their garage door opening systems.
