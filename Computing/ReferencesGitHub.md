## [Software Package Data Exchange](SoftwareDataPackageExchange.md)

[Software Package Data Exchange, SPDX,](https://spdx.dev) seems to have made licensing more complex with this explosion of other licenses that I didn't know existed. [Software Data Package Exchange, aka, SPDX](SoftwareDataPackageExchange.md) has all known links to research and reference for links that I got from [sdpx.dev/](https://spdx.dev/).

### Assessment of Software Package Data Exchange Licenses 

The following licenses from the [Software Package Data Exchange](https://spdx.org/) are those that are OSI approved that mandate reciprocal source code sharing.

### [SPDX License List / Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.org/licenses/ ).

I went through the list of licenses listed on: [SPDX License List / Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.org/licenses/ ) and reviewed the licenses that have OSI marked as Y since OSI is an international standards organization. The usual IANAL[^101] applies to my assessment. I chose those licenses where, in my opinion, the entity modifying the source must reciprocate and  publish their source code modifications. 

[^101]: I am not a lawyer.
