#### Cook's Note from Tanya Osmond:

Whatever jambalaya recipe you use, take your time and let the meat brown to a nice deep golden color â€” in batches if the pan is too crowded. Don't worry if the pan looks a little too dark. Scrape up the browned bits when you add your liquid. All the caramelized bits will add a ton of flavor to your final dish.

#### Greek Coffee 

##### Greek Coffee â€” Microsoft Bing

To make authentic Greek coffee, you will need the following ingredients and equipment:

- Finely-ground, dark roasted coffee beans (extra fine)
- White or brown sugar to taste
- Water
- A traditional briki, or Greek coffee pot
- Demitasse cups for serving
- A gas stove or a single-burner camp stove

A briki is a special metal pot that has an hourglass or cauldron shape and a long handle. It is used to brew the coffee directly on the heat source. A demitasse cup is a small cup that holds about 2 to 3 ounces (59 to 89 ml) of coffee. [Greek coffee is served with foam on top (kaimaki) and the grounds at the bottom of the cup](https://www.mygreekdish.com/recipe/greek-coffee-recipe-how-to-make-greek-coffee-ellinikos-kafes/).[^11][^12] Â¹Â²

You can adjust the amount of sugar and coffee according to your preference. There are four main types of Greek coffee based on the proportions of ingredients:

- Sketos (plain, no sugar): [1](https://www.mygreekdish.com/recipe/greek-coffee-recipe-how-to-make-greek-coffee-ellinikos-kafes/) heaping teaspoon of coffee per cup
- Metrios (medium sweetness): 1 heaping teaspoon of coffee and 1 teaspoon of sugar per cup
- Glykos (sweet): 1 heaping teaspoon of coffee and [2](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Greek-Coffee) teaspoons of sugar per cup
- Vary glykos (extra-strong sweet coffee): 2 teaspoons of coffee and 3 teaspoons of sugar per cup

To brew Greek coffee, follow these steps:

- Measure the water using the demitasse cup and pour it into the briki.
- Add the coffee and sugar and stir well.
- Place the briki over low to medium heat and watch it carefully.
- When the coffee starts to rise and form a thick layer of foam, remove it from the heat and pour it into the demitasse cup, making sure to preserve the foam.
- Let the coffee settle for a few minutes before drinking it. [Enjoy it slowly and sip the liquid, not the grounds](https://www.mygreekdish.com/recipe/greek-coffee-recipe-how-to-make-greek-coffee-ellinikos-kafes/).[^13]

Greek coffee is traditionally served with a glass of cold water and some sweets or snacks. It is a great way to relax and savor the flavor of this unique brew.[^15] ðŸ˜Š
