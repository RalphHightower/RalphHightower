[^11]: I haven't been there, but I enjoy oysters, seafood, and steak.
[^12]: Hamburgers are their specialty. They have fourteen different toppings for their burgers 
[^13]: Their Shrimp and Grits are excellent. Get their she-crab soup also.
[^14]: They are the standard that I measure all sushi 🍣  places by.
[^15]: It is my executive decision to make exceptions for franchises and multi-store locations because of the quality of their food.
[^16]: You don't go to a renowned steak house for fish or chicken.
[^17]: Villa Tronco is the oldest Italian restaurant in South Carolina. Their restaurant provided "comfort food" for Italian-Americans Army recruits training at Camp Jackson during WW II.
[^18]: I haven't eaten there yet, but I enjoy Cajun cuisine. 
[^19]: Third Friday through third Sunday. Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Columbia, South Carolina
