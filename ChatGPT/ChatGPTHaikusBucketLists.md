## Bucket List *(the Traditional Before I Die)*

### Arecibo Observatory *(Before the Cable Collapse)*[^11]

[^11]: Two cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. The NSF determined in November 2020 that it was safer to decommission the telescope rather than to try to repair it, but the telescope collapsed before a controlled demolition could be carried out. The remaining support cables from one tower failed around 7:56 a.m. local time on December 1, 2020, causing the receiver platform to fall into the dish and collapsing the telescope

Manhattanhenge occurs a couple of days before and after the summer solstice (around May 28th and July 12th) when the sun is positioned at its highest point in the sky.|
|During these dates, you can witness Manhattanhenge by standing on a street that runs east to west in Manhattan, such as 14th, 34th, or 42nd Street, and looking towards the west. It's a popular event for photographers and enthusiasts who gather to capture the stunning sight of the setting sun perfectly aligned with the city streets.|

## Hewlett-Packard RPN[^51] Calculators 

| *"RalphHightower"* / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|---|
| *"Good morning, AI Assistant."* |
|Good morning! How can I assist you today?|
| *"I've been a huge fan of Hewlett-Packard RPN calculators. For those not familiar with Revere Polish Notation, could you explain to others what it is? How to use it?"* |
|Of course! Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows its operands. It was popularized by Hewlett-Packard (HP) calculators and is used to perform calculations without the need for parentheses or explicit operator precedence rules. RPN calculators have been well-loved by many due to their efficient and straightforward approach to computation.|
|In traditional algebraic notation, like the one we usually write on paper, operators are placed between operands. For example, in algebraic notation, we write "3 + 4" to indicate the addition of 3 and 4. On the other hand, in RPN, we write the operands first, and then the operator. So, "3 + 4" in RPN becomes "3 4 +".|
|Here's how you would use RPN to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:|
|Addition: To add two numbers, simply enter them one after the other, followed by the "+" operator. For example, to calculate 3 + 4, you would enter "3 4 +" into the calculator.|
|Subtraction: To subtract one number from another, enter the first number, then the second number, and finally the "-" operator. For example, to calculate 5 - 2, you would enter "5 2 -".|
|Multiplication: To multiply two numbers, enter them one after the other, followed by the "*" operator. For example, to calculate 6 * 8, you would enter "6 8 *".|
|Division: To divide one number by another, enter the first number, then the second number, and finally the "/" operator. For example, to calculate 10 / 2, you would enter "10 2 /".|
|Here's a more complex example that includes both addition and multiplication:|
|To calculate (3 + 4) * 2, in RPN, you would do the following:|
|Enter "3" (operand)|
|Enter "4" (operand)|
|Enter "+" (operator)|
|Enter "2" (operand)|
|Enter "*" (operator)|
|After entering the last operator, the calculator will display the result, which in this case would be "14".|
|The key advantage of RPN is that it eliminates the need for parentheses and avoids ambiguity in complex calculations. It also requires fewer keystrokes for calculations since you don't have to use parentheses or explicitly specify the order of operations.|
|HP calculators were famous for their implementation of RPN, and many users found them highly efficient and user-friendly for performing various mathematical computations.|
| *"Thank you. I hope that explains to novices about how to use RPN.^* |
|You're welcome! I'm glad I could help explain Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and how to use it. RPN might seem a bit different at first, but once you get the hang of it, it can be a powerful and efficient way to perform calculations. If you or anyone else has any more questions, feel free to ask.|
| *"Could you create haikus about each Hewlett-Packard calculators, the HP-35, HP-45, HP-67, HP-16C, HP-41CV, and HP-48GX?"* |
|Certainly! Here are haikus dedicated to each of the Hewlett-Packard calculators you mentioned:|
| **HP-35:** |
|Classic and precise,<br />HP-35, your digits<br />Ignite minds with math.|
| **HP-45:** |
|Forty-five graces,<br />RPN prowess shines bright,<br />Calculator's might.|
| **HP-67:** |
|Program with intent,<br />HP-67, code's delight,<br />Solving challenges.|
| **HP-16C:** |
|Scientific soul,<br />HP-16C, steadfast guide,<br />Numbers, logic flow.|
| **HP-41CV:** |
|Versatile toolset,<br />HP-41CV, modules bind,<br />Calculations vast.|
| **HP-48GX:** |
|Graphing powerhouse,<br />HP-48GX, bold and strong,<br />Mathematical song.|
|These haikus celebrate the different models of Hewlett-Packard calculators, each with its own unique features and contributions to the world of mathematics and computation.
| *"Excellent. Thank you."* |
|You're very welcome! I'm glad you liked the haikus. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, feel free to ask."* |
| *"Cheers."* |
