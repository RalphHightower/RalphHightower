## Athena, Zeus, and River 

Zeus is the male with his tail half white. Athena is his sister and her tail has a flame tip of white. River is the younger Beagle with the large swath of white on her right shoulder.

Different cancers cut Zeus' and Athena's life far too short in spite of our best efforts to provide vetinary care and cancer specialists with surgery, radiation, and chemo. 

For Zeus' last day, we also took Athena and River with us. Since Paula and I  held Zeus as the drugs were given, there was no interaction with Athena or River. 

On Athena's last day, she was laid down on a towel on the floor. What River did next was touching. She laid down next to Athena back touching back as Athena received the drugs.

We knew that River has separation anxiety without Zeus and Athena. When it became apparent that Athena was not going to survive cancer, Paula put the wheels in motion to adop an adult. River was morning the loss of Athena. 

## River and Austin 

Austin's owner/breeder has passed away in Illinois. A foster home was provided for him in Arizona. We drove up to the Raleigh Airport to pick him up. River was not the gracious hostess for Austin's first day. But they were playing together on his second day 
River's identification hasn't changed. Austin is the older male.

## Obituaries 

I start writing obituaries for our Beagles with Sweetheart. 

| Beagle | Birth | Death | Obituary |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Lynmax Heart and Soul (Sweetheart) | 2001-12-10 | 2016-01-29 |  Lynmax Heart and Soul (Sweetheart) crossed over the Rainbow Bridge on January 29th, 2016.  She was born on December 10th, 2001 to Harnett’s Centerfold (Jill).  She was lovingly raised from birth by Ralph and Paula Hightower along with her littermate Lynmax Wherefore Bark Thou (Romeo).  She follows her mom, Jill, and her brother, Romeo, to Rainbow Bridge.  She is survived by her two sons, Ch. Lynmax Apollo (Pauly), Lynmax Zeus (Zeus), and daughter, Lynmax Athena (Athena). Sweetheart enjoyed chasing rabbits and treeing squirrels and passed her talent onto Athena and Zeus, although they haven’t mastered her knack for climbing trees after squirrels (four feet off the ground in a tree).  She was also a talented escape artist, able to open doors of kennel crates if it wasn’t bungeed shut.  After enduring a seven month battle of oral melanoma and lymphoma, Sweetie went to sleep in Paula’s lap with Ralph stroking her head, assisted by her co-owner, Dr. Davida Roof DVM.<br><br>Sweetheart joins the other members of the Hightower Beagle pack over 38 years, who have gone on before her (not listed in chronological order): Ranger and Runner, Writer, Rebecca (Becky), Patton and Princess, Traveler and Trucker (notice a pattern here), Sport, Lady, Jill, Chaser, Rebel, and Romeo.   Her pain and suffering from cancer gone, restored to new youth and vigor at Rainbow Bridge, she is enjoying life once again, while anticipating her owners Ralph and Paula, with the current and future members of the pack, to join her. |
| Lynmax Zeus (Zeus) | 2009-01-14 | 2020-10-27 | Lynmax Zeus (Zeus) crossed over the Rainbow Bridge on October 27, 220. He was born on January 14, 2009 to Lynmax Heart and Soul (Sweetheart); his birth date is the birthday of his maternal grandmother, Ch. Harnett’s Centerfold (Jill). He was lovingly raised from birth by Ralph and Paula Hightower along with his littermate Lynmax Athena (Athena). He follows his mom, Sweetheart, and his maternal grandmother, Jill, to Rainbow Bridge. He is survived by two littermates, brother, Ch. Lynmax Apollo (Pauly) owned by Dr. Davida Roof DVM, and sister, Athena and four-year old Encore River of Dreams (River) from Encore Beagles of Anniston, Alabama. He had a great, happy attitude in a small package and a great voice. Zeus enjoyed treeing squirrels, a talent passed onto him from his mother. Zeus was in the lead photograph of the article “Tips on Training a Squirrel Dog” published by Alabama Wildlife magazine. Zeus was punctual about dinnertime and bedtime, letting Ralph and Paula know what time it was; although the yearly time changes tripped him up for a few days. Zeus had a knack for calling the girls, Sweetheart, Athena, and River, to dinnertime and bedtime. After enduring a six-month battle of oral melanoma with surgery, radiation, and chemo, Zeus went to sleep in Ralph and Paula’s lap, assisted by his co-owner, Dr. Davida Roof DVM; Athena and River were also there to say goodbye. Ralph and Paula thank the staff at Blythewood Animal Hospital in Blythewood, SC, Upstate Vet in Greenville, SC, and South Carolina Veterinary Specialists and Emergency Care for their treatment of Zeus and his cancer<br><br>Zeus joins the other members of the Hightower Beagle pack over 43 years, who have gone on before him (not listed in chronological order): Ranger and Runner, Writer, Rebecca (Becky), Patton and Princess, Traveler and Trucker (notice a pattern here), Sport, Lady, Jill, Chaser, Rebel, Romeo and Sweetheart. His pain and suffering from cancer gone, restored to new youth and vigor at Rainbow Bridge, he is enjoying life once again, while anticipating his owners Ralph and Paula, with the current and future members of the pack, to join him.
| Lynmax Athena (Athena) | 2009-01-14 | 2020-11-30 | Lynmax Athena (Athena) crossed over the Rainbow Bridge on November 30, 2020. She was born on January 14, 2009 to Lynmax Heart and Soul (Sweetheart); her birth date is also the birthday of her maternal grandmother, Ch. Harnett’s Centerfold (Jill). She was lovingly raised from birth by Ralph and Paula Hightower along with her littermate Lynmax Zeus (Zeus). She follows her brother, Zeus, her mom, Sweetheart, and her maternal grandmother, Jill, to Rainbow Bridge. She is survived by one littermate, brother, Ch. Lynmax Apollo (Paul) owned by Dr. Davida Roof DVM and four-year old Encore River of Dreams (River) from Encore Beagles of Anniston, Alabama. Athena demanded attention; she didn’t mind one paying attention to another dog as long as you had one hand on her. Athena enjoyed treeing squirrels; a talent passed onto her from her mother. Although Athena is the spitting image of her mother in build, she never got the hang of getting in a tree after a squirrel like her mother. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in June 2019; treatment included surgery for removal, followed by chemotherapy. In August 2020, Athena was due to end chemo, but developed inflammatory digestive disease along with liver cancer. Medications and chemo failed to restore a normal Beagle appetite and she gradually lost weight. Athena went to sleep with Ralph and Paula stroking her and River laying by her side, assisted by her co-owner, Dr. Davida Roof DVM. Ralph and Paula thank the staff at Blythewood Animal Hospital in Blythewood, SC for her regular veterinary care, and South Carolina Veterinary Specialists and Emergency Care in Columbia, SC for their treatment of Athena and her cancers and digestive diseases.<br><br>Athena joins the other members of the Hightower Beagle pack over 43 years, who have gone on before her (not listed in chronological order): Ranger and Runner, Writer, Rebecca (Becky), Patton and Princess, Traveler and Trucker (notice a pattern here), Sport, Lady, Jill, Chaser, Rebel, Romeo and Sweetheart, and Zeus. Her pain and suffering from disease gone, restored to new youth and vigor at Rainbow Bridge, she is enjoying life once again, while anticipating her owners Ralph and Paula, with the current and future members of the pack, to join her.
