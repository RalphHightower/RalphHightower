## Athena, Zeus, and River 

Zeus is the male with his tail half white. Athena is his sister and her tail has a flame tip of white. River is the younger Beagle with the large swath of white on her right shoulder.

Different cancers cut Zeus' and Athena's life far too short in spite of our best efforts to provide vetinary care and cancer specialists with surgery, radiation, and chemo. 

For Zeus' last day, we also took Athena and River with us. Since Paula and I  held Zeus as the drugs were given, there was no interaction with Athena or River. 

On Athena's last day, she was laid down on a towel on the floor. What River did next was touching. She laid down next to Athena back touching back as Athena received the drugs.

We knew that River has separation anxiety without Zeus and Athena. When it became apparent that Athena was not going to survive cancer, Paula put the wheels in motion to adop an adult. River was morning the loss of Athena. 

## River and Austin 

Austin's owner/breeder has passed away in Illinois. A foster home was provided for him in Arizona. We drove up to the Raleigh Airport to pick him up. River was not the gracious hostess for Austin's first day. But they were playing together on his second day 
River's identification hasn't changed. Austin is the older male.
