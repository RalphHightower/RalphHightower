#  Opinions/Donald Trump Is a Fucking Idiot

## 1.	My Personal Opinion

Besides the title of this page, Donald Trump is a temperamental, belligerent, mercurial, egotistical, childish, unintelligent ass; he is unfit, and unqualified to be president of the United States of America.
Leadership is not intimidation and fear. Trump has absolutely, no fucking clue as to how government works. He thinks that he can run government like his family owned business. Trump thinks that he can just bark orders and people will jump through hoops like a circus poodle and that he can fire and hire federal employees at will.

I don't understand this idolatry of Trump and his cult worship.

Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC) has the attention span of a squirrel. After the attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021, Graham said <"That's it! I'm done with Trump."* He was on NBC's Meet The Press after the failed assassination of Trump in 2024. He said that he was supposed to play golf with Trump that weekend. Graham is one of Trump's sycophants. He has he head so far up  Trump's ass that he doesn't know if it's night or day.

[Senator Tim Scott (T-SC) – Meet the Press. May 5, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/federal-funding-is-a-privilege-not-a-right-tim-scott-tells-college-presidents-full-interview-210290757680) refused to answer a simple 'yes/no' answer to the question "Will you accept the election results if Trump loses?". Scott is Trump's "lawn jockey". He does not have the courage to stand for what's right. 

A true leader recognizes and praises their team for their successes and accepts blame and responsibility when things fail. Trump claims credit for others' accomplishment, the *"I did that all by myself!"*, and blames others for his failures, the *"It's not my fault."*[^111]
[^111]: **The Victim Card.** Trump plays the victim card when things don't go his way, or f ail. *"It's not my fault. It's the Democrats fault."* Or someone else's fault.

Both political parties fucked up in 2016.
- The Democrats chose Hillary because it was *"her turn"*.
- Whereas the Republicans chose the worst of the worst. The Republican Party died in 2016. It is now the Trump Party, and also his legal defense fund for business, personal, and also government legal problems.

Trump cannot handle the abuse and criticism that he dishes out to others. For the life of me, I cannot fathom why Trump chose to run. Here’s how I think that Trump decided.

In the Trump penthouse, here's how I think he made his decision.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Child | "Father, when I grow up, I want to be president."|
| Trump | "Barron, here. Hold my beer. Watch this."[^112] |

[^112]: A common phrase that often said before something stupid and more than probably disastrous.

- Charlatan
- Cheat
- Fraud
- Grifter
- Huckster
- Pathological Liar

**The only person that can convince me that Donald Trump is not a fucking idiot is Donald Trump himself.**

*How?*

- Tame your temper! Quit throwing **Trumper Tantrums!**
- Quit your pathological lying and tell the God-damned truth!
- By growing up and treating people with respect. I.e., quit that childish behavior of calling people names.
- Be a true leader! A true leader recognizes team members, and subordinates for their accomplishment, and accepts the blame when things fail.
- Accept the fact that the president lives under a microscope. You will be praised by some and condemned others.

Trump may act *"presidential"* for five minutes, but it is impossible for him to be an adult.

### Trump's Wives

| Wife | Married | Divorced | Nationality | Settlement | Alimony | Fringe Benefits |

In 2018, Knavs and her husband, Viktor, obtained green cards and then became naturalized U.S. citizens using the U.S.'s family-based immigration program, which Trump had denounced as "chain migration".[^323]<br />

Maples and Trump separated in May 1997 and divorced on June 8, 1999

### Trump's Mistresses (Extramarital Affairs, One Night Stands)

I always thought that Trump was *"test driving"* Marla Maples while still married to Ivana Trump. Likewise, he was *"test driving"* Melania Trump while still married to Marla Maples. Of course everyone knows about porn star Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump, and to a lesser extent, Playboy Playmate, and Playmate Of The Year, Karen McDougal while married to Melania Trump.

Donald Trump has the same problem that Bill Clinton does.[^351]

[^351]:  A problem with their zipper.

## 4. Donald Trump is a Perv and Voyuer

Apparently, since Trump owned the Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants, he thought that it was his right to walk into their dressing rooms. Many women and teenage girls were in various states of undress, ranging from topless to totally nude.

Several former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contestants accused Trump of entering the dressing rooms of beauty pageant contestants while contestants were in various stages of undress. Trump had already referred to this practice during a 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show, saying he could "get away with things like that" because he owned the Miss Universe franchise. In October 2019, the book All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator contained 43 additional allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump[^411]

Trump has denied all the allegations against him, saying he has been the victim of media bias, conspiracies, and a political smear campaign. In October 2016, Trump publicly vowed to sue all the women who have made allegations of sexual misconduct against him, as well as The New York Times for publishing the allegations.[^412]

## 5.	Not a Savvy Businessman. Multiple Bankruptcies. Scores of Business Failures.

Trump is not the savvy businessman that he thinks he is and brags to everyone that he is.

- Six bank​rupt​cies[^511]
   1. 1991. In 1991, Trump Taj Mahal was unable to service its debt and filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Forbes indicated that this first bankruptcy was the only one where Trump's personal financial resources were involved. Time, however, maintains that \$72 million of his personal money was also involved in a later 2004 bankruptcy.
    2.  1992. On November 2, 1992, the Trump Plaza Hotel filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Trump lost his 49 percent stake in the luxury hotel to Citibank and five other lenders. In return Trump received more favorable terms on the remaining \$550+ million owed to the lenders, and retain his position as chief executive, though he would not be paid and would not have a role in day-to-day operations.
    3.  2004. Donald Trump's third corporate bankruptcy was on October 21, 2004, involving Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, the publicly traded holding company for his three Atlantic City casinos and some others. Trump lost over half of his 56% ownership and gave bondholders stock in exchange for surrendering part of the debt. No longer CEO, Trump retained a role as chairman of the board. In May.
    4.  2005. The company emerged from bankruptcy as Trump Entertainment Resorts Holdings. In his 2007 book, Think BIG and Kick Ass in Business and Life, Trump wrote: "I figured it was the bank's problem, not mine. What the hell did I care? I actually told one bank, **'I told you you shouldn't have loaned me that money. I told you the goddamn deal was no good.'**"[^111]
    5.  2009. Trump's fourth corporate bankruptcy occurred in 2009, when Trump and his daughter Ivanka resigned from the board of Trump Entertainment Resorts; four days later the company, which owed investors \$1\.74 billion against its \$2\.06 billion of assets, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At that time, Trump Entertainment Resorts had three properties in Atlantic City: Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (closed in 2014), and Trump Marina (formerly Trump's Castle, sold in 2011). Trump and some investors bought the company back that same year for \$225 million. As part of the agreement, Trump withdrew a \$100 million lawsuit he had filed against the casino's owners alleging damage to the Trump brand. Trump re-negotiated the debt, reducing by over \}}\$1 billion the repayments required to bondholders.
    6.  2014. Trump sued his former company to remove his name from the buildings since he no longer ran the company, having no more than a 10% stake; he lost the suit. Trump Entertainment Resorts filed again for bankruptcy in 2014 and was purchased by billionaire philanthropist Carl Icahn in 2016, who acquired Trump Taj Mahal in the deal.
- Failed businesses[^515]<sup>,</sup>[^516]
    1. Donald J. Trump Foundation – charitable foundation shut down in 2018 due to legal issues
    2. Donald J. Trump Signature Collection, a line of menswear launched at Macy's in 2004, and involved in a lawsuit and subsequent trial. Discontinued in 2015, after comments Trump made about Mexican immigrants.

    13. Trump Beverages — Although Trump touted his water as "one of the purest natural spring waters bottled in the world," it was simply bottled by a third party. Other beverages, including Trump Fire and Trump Power, seem not to have made it to market. And Trump's American Pale Ale died with a trademark withdrawal.
    14. Trump Casino in Indiana.
    15. Trump Castle (renamed Trump Marina in 1997) in Atlantic City, New Jersey; sold to Landry’s, Inc. in 2011 and renamed the Golden Nugget Atlantic City.

    28. Trump Mortgage — Trump told CNBC in 2006 that "I think it's a great time to start a mortgage company. … The real-estate market is going to be very strong for a long time to come." Then the real estate market collapsed. Trump had hired E.J. Ridings as CEO of Trump Mortgage and boasted that Ridings had been a "top executive of one of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banks." Turned out Ridings had only six months of experience as a stockbroker. Trump Mortgage closed and never paid a \$298,274 judgment it owed a former employee, nor the \$3,555 it owed in unpaid taxes.

    36. Trump Tower Tampa — Trump sold his name to the developers and received \$2 million. Then the project went belly-up with only \$3,500 left in the company. Condo buyers sued Trump for allegedly misleading them. Trump settled and paid as little as \$11,115 to buyers who had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
    37. Trump University or the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative — Trump staged wealth-building seminars costing up to $34,995 for mentorships that would offer students access to Trump's secrets of success. Instructors turned out to be motivational speakers sometimes with criminal records. Lawsuits and criminal investigations abound.
    38. Trump Vodka — Business failed due to a lack of sales.
    39. Trump World’s Fair at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Operated as a wing of Trump Plaza, but with its own casino license, it was closed in 1999, and demolished in 2000.
    40. Trump's Travel Site — GoTrump.com was in business for one year. Failed.
    41. Trumpnet — A telephone communication company that abandoned its trademark.
    42. Truth Social — This existing Trump business owes big money, and may well be breathing its last.
 - By mid-2016, it was alleged that the organization, specifically under the leadership of Donald Trump, had a history of not paying for services rendered. Several hundred contractors or workers for the organization have filed lawsuits or liens saying they were not paid for their work, and others say they had to settle for cents on the dollar.[^513]
- Convicted of tax fraud for inflating property values for better finance terms and rates and deflating property values for property tax. NY. This practice of inflating and deflating property values when convenient is sure to occur in other states where Trump owns property.

Chairman Neal’s request for Trump’s taxes came after the president’s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen testified before Congress on February 27 that as a businessman, Trump allegedly inflated the value of assets to apply for bank loans and deflated the same assets to avoid paying taxes.[^611]

## 7. Everything Is a Transaction to Trump. Even Relationships

[Donald Trump admits EV flip-flop was a quid pro quo to secure Elon Musk’s support / Fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-endorsement/)[^711]. August 5, 2024 at 8:48 AM EDT

I questioned the mental acuity of South Carolina's Lieutenant Governor, Henry McMaster, when he endorsed Trump for president. Looking back on Trump selecting then South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to be the US delegate to the United Nations, it makes perfect sense. Trump, "Psst. Hey Henry, if you endose me for president, I'll make you Governor of South Carolina." McMaster: "You got yourself a deal!"

[^711]: Everything is a transaction for Trump. He *"buys"* people and disposes of them when they no longer are of value to him.

## 8.	Barak Obama

While Oama was president, Trump complained continually that Obama was not an American and demand proof that he was, in fact, born in America. Trump also whined that Obama plays too much golf, which I find ironic since Trump golfs as much as possible at his golf courses.

[Trump is losing a winnable election. He has no one to blame but himself.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/08/25/trump-harris-2024-election/74863488007/). August 25, 2024
- Trump is behind because he lacks discipline
    - Trump's biggest obstacle is Trump.
        - Reporting on a news conference is a nightmare because Trump cannot commit to the self-discipline that it takes to prepare ahead of time, pare his thoughts to a handful of strong talkingl points and then cogently answer questions on what his administration would look like.
        - Trump insists on coming across like a moron. His thoughts and ideas flow with a stream of consciousness that makes William Faulkner look like a children's nursery rhyme. He jumps from idea to idea like a hip-hop artist doing a break dancing routine at the Olympic level.
        - When he talks about his record or his plans for a second term, it's a jumbled, garbled mess of word salad.
- Trump loves himself more than he loves America
        - Trump also is behind because he loves himself more than he really loves America. The former president's campaign is mostly focused on himself. It's not really about making America great again. It's more about pumping up Trump's already overinflated ego.
        - Trump's personality doesn't allow him to accept advice or learn from his mistakes. Only people who accept responsibility for their behavior can find the courage to ask for help and really listen to it.
        - Trump is incredibly self-absorbed.
        - Even after nearly being killed, Trump went back to posting rants on Truth Social like a 9-year-old boy having a Trumper Tantrum.
        - Instead of being disciplined, strategic and precise, he's flailing. He's frenetic, mean and boastful.
- Trump's own history haunts him
    - Trump's character flaws, including his sordid history with women and his many legal troubles. Those are the things that come to people's minds when they see Trump's name flash across their television screen.
    - Trump has been indicted in four criminal cases and found guilty in his hush money conviction that warranted a felony, concealing the bribery as a business expense. He still demonstrates patterns of making poor choices and skirting the law.
    - Trump has repeatedly behaved like a misogynist. He has been dishonest when he should have told the truth. He has not lived in a manner befitting a U.S. president. Those flaws have repulsed many Americans.
- Trump is behind because he can't focus on Harris
    - Trump's biggest pitfall is his inability to focus on his opponent in any serious way.
    - Trump loses focus. The next thing you know he's recalling a moment he had at Mar-a-Lago with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a "beautiful sofa."
    - Trump's inability to stay on point while speaking fits within a larger pattern of being unable to spend significant amounts of time and energy focused.

## [Sycophant — Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sycophant)

noun<br />
sy·​co·​phant | \ ˈsi-kə-fənt , also ˈsī-, -ˌfant \<br />
Definition<br />
: a servile self-seeking flatterer<br />
Other Words<br />
sycophant adjective<br />
Synonyms & Antonyms<br />
Synonymsapple-polisher, bootlicker, brownnoser, fawner, flunky (also flunkey or flunkie), lickspittle, suck-up, toady<br />
Examples<br />
//be careful not to mistake sycophants for true friends<br />
First Known Use<br />
1575, in the meaning defined above<br />
History and Etymology<br />
borrowed from Latin sȳcophanta, borrowed from Greek sȳkophántēs, literally, "one who shows the fig," from sŷkon "fig" (perhaps in reference to an apotropaic gesture made by inserting the thumb between the index and second fingers) + -phantēs, agentive derivative of phaínein "to reveal, show, make known"; perhaps from the use of such a gesture in denouncing a culprit — more at fig entry 1, fantasy entry 1<br />
NOTE: The origin of Greek sȳkophántēs, applied in ancient Athens to private individuals who brought prosecutions in which they had no personal stake, was already under debate by ancient writers. The "apotropaic gesture" hypothesis given here was presented early on by Arthur Bernard Cook ("CΥΚΟΦΑΝΤΗC," The Classical Review, vol. 21, issue 5 [August, 1907], pp. 133-36); Cook also usefully summarizes ancient speculation (as the idea that the original sȳkophántēs denounced those who illegally exported figs from Attica). The objection has been made that the basic notion "one who makes the fig gesture" does not account for the extremely negative connotations of the word ("slanderer, calumniator, etc."), but other explanations (as, for example, that a sȳkophántēs revealed figs hidden in a malefactor's clothing, or initiated a prosecution for something of as little value as a fig) seem even less likely. A more nuanced, if not entirely convincing account, based on presumed fig metaphors in Athenian culture, is in Danielle Allen, The World of Prometheus: The Politics of Punishing in Democratic Athens (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 156 passim. — The application of sycophant to a flatterer, which departs entirely from the Greek meaning, is peculiar to the history of the word in English. In the sixteenth century English writers seem to have applied sycophant in particular to slanderous accusers who had found their way into the retinue of the powerful. Once the word became a generally used label for ill-willed people close to those in power, it presumably became associated with obsequious flattery, a stereotypical negative quality of such people.<br />

## [Cronyism — Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2024/09/03/)

What It Means<br />
Cronyism is the unfair practice by a powerful person (such as a politician) of giving jobs and other favors to friends without regard for their qualifications.<br />
<br />
// City residents are pushing back against cronyism and corruption in their local government.<br />
<br />
See the entry ><br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
“Expertise, not cronyism, is needed to determine which strategies are most likely to lead to meaningful gains.” — Time, 23 Aug. 2023<br />
Did you know?<br />
The word cronyism evolved in the 19th century as a spin-off of crony, meaning “friend” or “pal.” In its younger days, cronyism simply meant “friendship,” or “the ability to make friends.” The word didn’t turn bad until the next century, when Americans starting using it to refer to the act of playing political favorites. If cronyism is new to your vocabulary, perhaps you’re more familiar with the related term nepotism, meaning “favoritism based on kinship, especially in professional and political contexts.”<br />
