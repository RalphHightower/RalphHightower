Mamma Mikki’s. Shorty’s Smokin’ Butts. And, of course, Tracy’s Elephant Ears.<br>*“I guess I’m gonna chalk this up to a good thing about the Murdaugh trial, but there’s better lunch options for a while,”* said Hillary Jacobs, the owner of Lowcountry Nutrition. She had strolled up Walterboro’s three-block main street to check out the brisket chili and pulled pork sammies at the Live Oak Smokehouse.<br>As for the idea that those same food trucks at a double homicide trial made light of a serious event, Blaine Colson of Blazin’ Blaine’s Deep Fried Goodies shook his head vigorously from within the dark cavern of his truck. *“The city asked us,”* he said.<br>Besides, according to Scott Grooms, the city’s director of tourism and downtown development, the food trucks had already proved their value by 10 a.m., when reporters started entering the courthouse to watch jury selection.<br>*“They’ve had a good, steady business this morning,”* said Grooms, who strolled like an affable waiter among the media clusters, making sure everyone had internet, caffeine, and access to Taj Ma Stall, a high-end port-a-potty.<br> *“I’m sure online there will be some complaints. But it’s one of those things where, you know, we didn’t ask for this, but we prepared for it.”* |

It would also dovetail nicely into one of the key witnesses in the case, who is expected to testify they saw Murdaugh *“hiding evidence”* in the aftermath of the murders at his parents home in Almeda, S.C.<br>It could also point to a potential accomplice in the crimes … or perhaps an accessory after the fact.<br>Furthermore, the testimony Greer is expected to provide would severely undermine Murdaugh’s claim that the *“real killers”* of his wife and son were vigilantes looking to kill Paul as retribution for his involvement in a fatal 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. |

He further found Greer was *“well-qualified”* to speak to the subject matter at issue. Finally, Newman rejected the defense’s contention that ballistics evidence was not an established science.<br>*“The underlying science is solid,”* Newman said at the conclusion of a two-and-a-half hour hearing on Tuesday afternoon.<br>Murdaugh’s attorney Griffin did an admirable job pushing back against Greer’s findings, challenging him on his contention that 300 blackout cartridges fired at the murder scene *“came from the same weapon that fired .300 blackout cartridges at (a) shooting range and near the residence.”*<br>*“Are you able to state with a reasonable degree of certainty that only one weapon in the world could have made these marks?”* Griffin asked Greer.<br>Greer repeatedly referred to *“matching mechanism marks”* on the ammunition, which led him to conclude the projectiles *“came from the same firearm.”* <br> Griffin pushed back, saying Greer could be confusing the fact that ammunition from guns *“produced in the same production lots have identical markings.”*<br> Greer responded that his analysis – which was confirmed by two independent SLED analyses – was based on *“pattern matching”* that enabled him to *“distinguish and correctly identify”* the weapon from others manufactured in the same lot.<br>As SLED agents continue searching diligently for these weapons, Greer was able to conclude something significant … that .300 blackout cartridges found at a shooting range and near the residence were *“loaded into, extracted and ejected from the same firearm at some previous time.”* <br> In other words, while prosecutors may not have the murder weapons in hand – *they can point to the next best thing: That those weapons allegedly belonged to the Murdaugh’s and were used on the Murdaugh’s property on previous occasions.* |

They are spread out, it sounds like, and they are just talking back and forth.”*<br>*“They are talking about the different game birds out there,”* Monk’s source continued. *“I think one of the dogs was chasing or caught a chicken. There’s talk of that. You can hear a little bit of laughter.”*<br>Monk acknowledged the existence of this video was first reported by our news outlet back in June, but according to him we did not at that time *“characterize the contents other than to say it showed Murdaugh and Maggie talking by the dog kennels on the Moselle estate.”*<br>In addition to his sources, Monk’s report was based on a court filing submitted by Harpootlian and attorney Jim Griffin on August 22, 2022.<br>*“On the recording, Paul is taking a video of his friend’s dog, who Paul was concerned about,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote. *“Apparently a conversation between Maggie, Paul and Alex is also captured on this recording. Family members report Maggie, Paul and Alex (were) having a convivial conversation about the behavior of their own dog, Bubba.”*<br>That is accurate. Because from the moment we were made aware of this clip, our news outlet was not provided with the same “happy family” narrative provided to Monk.<br>In addition to his sources, Monk’s report was based on a court filing submitted by Harpootlian and attorney Jim Griffin on August 22, 2022.<br>Harpootlian and Griffin’s description of the video as *“convivial”* (a.k.a. friendly, lively, cheerful or jovial) was key to their arguments before the court – and in the court of public opinion.<br>*“There is absolutely no indication of a disagreement or dispute between Paul, Maggie and Alex, according to family members who viewed the recording,”* the motion continued. *“However, the state contends that within minutes after this convivial, light-hearted conversation, Alex murdered both Maggie and Paul for no apparent reason.”*<br>Prior to watching the recording for the first time this week, our news outlet provided additional information on it in an article published on December 5, 2022. In that report, we noted the video was sent by Paul Murdaugh to a friend whose dog he was keeping in the kennels at Moselle. The dog – a chocolate Labrador retriever puppy belonging to Rogan Gibson – had an injured tail and Paul Murdaugh appears to have been trying to document its status for his childhood friend.<br>*“Hey he’s got a bird in his mouth!”* Maggie exclaimed on the video. *“It’s a guinea.”*<br>She was quickly corrected on this point by both her husband and her son.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Alex told his wife.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Paul confirmed.<br>Alex Murdaugh is not seen on the video, but he is clearly heard correcting his wife and calling out after the dog.<br>*“Come here, Bubba!”* Murdaugh is heard yelling. *“Come here, Bubba!”*<br>Monk acknowledged the existence of this video was first reported by our news outlet back in June, but according to him we did not at that time *“characterize the contents other than to say it showed Murdaugh and Maggie talking by the dog kennels on the Moselle estate.”*<br>In addition to his sources, Monk’s report was based on a court filing submitted by Harpootlian and attorney Jim Griffin on August 22, 2022.<br>*“On the recording, Paul is taking a video of his friend’s dog, who Paul was concerned about,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote. *“Apparently a conversation between Maggie, Paul and Alex is also captured on this recording.

The dog – a chocolate Labrador retriever puppy belonging to Rogan Gibson – had an injured tail and Paul Murdaugh appears to have been trying to document its status for his childhood friend.<br>As I noted in the December report, while Paul was filming his friend’s puppy, one of the Murdaugh hunting dogs – Bubba – began racing around the kennels (off-camera) with a chicken in its mouth. As the three family members – including Alex Murdaugh – called out for the dog, Maggie Murdaugh speculated the animal in its mouth was a guinea, not a chicken.<br> *“Hey he’s got a bird in his mouth!”* Maggie exclaimed on the video. *“It’s a guinea.”* <br> She was quickly corrected on this point by both her husband and her son.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Alex told his wife.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Paul confirmed.<br>Alex Murdaugh is not seen on the video, but he is clearly heard correcting his wife and calling out after the dog.<br>*“Come here, Bubba!”* Murdaugh is heard yelling.<br> *“Come here, Bubba!”* <br>More than a dozen people – including Murdaugh’s own family members and former law partners – have reportedly confirmed to law enforcement that the voice on the footage belonged to him. *Which it clearly is.* |

The 22-year-old survived the initial shots, Waters said, but a third shot did “catastrophic damage” to his head and brain. Evidence will show he collapsed outside a feed room near dog kennels at the Murdaughs’ expansive hunting property.<br>*“You’re going to see what he did to Maggie and Paul,”* Waters said. *“It’s going to be gruesome. There’s no other way around it.”*<br>Moments later, Alex Murdaugh picked up an AR-style rifle and opened fire *“just feet away”* on his wife Maggie, the prosecutor said.<br>*“Pow, pow,”* Waters said, mimicking gunshots fired first toward Maggie’s legs. Additional shots struck her head, instantly killing the mother of two, the prosecutor said.

[^1]: Here's my theory on why Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and his son, Paul. FITSNews has reported that Alex Murdaugh routinely overdrew his personal bank account by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paul was a legal and financial liability when he was charged with BUI (boating under the influence) when he crashed the boat into a bridge piling that resulted in numerous injuries and a fatality (Mallory Beach). Maggie, according to a People magazine article reported that Maggie was shopping for divorce attorneys. Both Maggie and Paul could bring down Murdaugh’s financial house of cards.
