Mamma Mikki’s. Shorty’s Smokin’ Butts. And, of course, Tracy’s Elephant Ears.<br>*“I guess I’m gonna chalk this up to a good thing about the Murdaugh trial, but there’s better lunch options for a while,”* said Hillary Jacobs, the owner of Lowcountry Nutrition. She had strolled up Walterboro’s three-block main street to check out the brisket chili and pulled pork sammies at the Live Oak Smokehouse.<br>As for the idea that those same food trucks at a double homicide trial made light of a serious event, Blaine Colson of Blazin’ Blaine’s Deep Fried Goodies shook his head vigorously from within the dark cavern of his truck. *“The city asked us,”* he said.<br>Besides, according to Scott Grooms, the city’s director of tourism and downtown development, the food trucks had already proved their value by 10 a.m., when reporters started entering the courthouse to watch jury selection.<br>*“They’ve had a good, steady business this morning,”* said Grooms, who strolled like an affable waiter among the media clusters, making sure everyone had internet, caffeine, and access to Taj Ma Stall, a high-end port-a-potty.<br> *“I’m sure online there will be some complaints. But it’s one of those things where, you know, we didn’t ask for this, but we prepared for it.”* |

It would also dovetail nicely into one of the key witnesses in the case, who is expected to testify they saw Murdaugh *“hiding evidence”* in the aftermath of the murders at his parents home in Almeda, S.C.<br>It could also point to a potential accomplice in the crimes … or perhaps an accessory after the fact.<br>Furthermore, the testimony Greer is expected to provide would severely undermine Murdaugh’s claim that the *“real killers”* of his wife and son were vigilantes looking to kill Paul as retribution for his involvement in a fatal 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. |

| January 24, 2023 | [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Scores Major Win On Ballistic Evidence, Testimony](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/24/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-scores-major-win-on-ballistic-evidence-testimony/)<br> *“Very significant piece of evidence …”* <br>Greer’s testimony – and the evidence he will testify to at trial – was the focus of an eleventh-hour defense motion filed on Monday by Murdaugh’s attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin.<br>According to that motion, Greer’s testimony should have been excluded – or limited – during the upcoming trial because *“his opinion testimony does not aid the trier of fact to understand the evidence.”*<br>S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman – who was tapped by the S.C. supreme court to handle this case back in September of 2021 – disagreed, allowing the state to admit what lead prosecutor Creighton Waters referred to as a *“very significant piece of evidence.”*<br>Newman ruled that prosecutors had “met the threshold” to include both the evidence and the accompanying testimony – concluding it would *“assist the jury”* in its deliberations. He further found Greer was *“well-qualified”* to speak to the subject matter at issue. Finally, Newman rejected the defense’s contention that ballistics evidence was not an established science.<br>*“The underlying science is solid,”* Newman said at the conclusion of a two-and-a-half hour hearing on Tuesday afternoon.<br>Murdaugh’s attorney Griffin did an admirable job pushing back against Greer’s findings, challenging him on his contention that 300 blackout cartridges fired at the murder scene *“came from the same weapon that fired .300 blackout cartridges at (a) shooting range and near the residence.”*<br>*“Are you able to state with a reasonable degree of certainty that only one weapon in the world could have made these marks?”* Griffin asked Greer.<br>Greer repeatedly referred to *“matching mechanism marks”* on the ammunition, which led him to conclude the projectiles *“came from the same firearm.”* <br> Griffin pushed back, saying Greer could be confusing the fact that ammunition from guns *“produced in the same production lots have identical markings.”*<br> Greer responded that his analysis – which was confirmed by two independent SLED analyses – was based on *“pattern matching”* that enabled him to *“distinguish and correctly identify”* the weapon from others manufactured in the same lot.<br>As SLED agents continue searching diligently for these weapons, Greer was able to conclude something significant … that .300 blackout cartridges found at a shooting range and near the residence were *“loaded into, extracted and ejected from the same firearm at some previous time.”* <br> In other words, while prosecutors may not have the murder weapons in hand – *they can point to the next best thing: That those weapons allegedly belonged to the Murdaugh’s and were used on the Murdaugh’s property on previous occasions.* |

[^1]: Here's my theory on why Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and his son, Paul. FITSNews has reported that Alex Murdaugh routinely overdrew his personal bank account by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paul was a legal and financial liability when he was charged with BUI (boating under the influence) when he crashed the boat into a bridge piling that resulted in numerous injuries and a fatality (Mallory Beach). Maggie, according to a People magazine article reported that Maggie was shopping for divorce attorneys. Both Maggie and Paul could bring down Murdaugh’s financial house of cards.
