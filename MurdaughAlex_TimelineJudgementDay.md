|Judge reverses course on cell phones in the courtroom … but does he have a point?|
|As for phones in court, Bender said *“there will be no cell phones in the courtroom – that’s been the rule in South Carolina for more than twenty years – and you won’t be able to use electronic devices certainly to file from the courtroom during the court proceedings to prevent distraction.”*<br>According to Bender, *“what reporters really want to do is tweet from the courtroom.”*|
|*“If you allow people to have cell phones – even if you have a rule that says no cell phones – they will be sitting with their hands under the desk sending tweets and if you have twenty reporters trying to do that at once it will be distracting to the process,”* he said.|
|*“The goal here is not to make life easy for reporters,”* Bender added. *“The goal is to have a fair trial for the defendant and to allow the public to learn what’s going on.”*

|Lawyers ask judge to exclude any discussion of disputed forensic report …<br>The latest filing (.pdf) focused more specifically Kinsey’s report – which claiming that *“(a)fter consideration of (Tom Bevel’s) opinion, analysis reports, and follow-up experimentation (by Tom Bevell), this expert cannot render an opinion on”* whether *”the blood stains on Alex’s white t-shirt [are] consistent with back spatter from a gunshot.”*|
|They further stated that *“without an opinion on whether the stains are ‘blood stains’ or whether the stains are ‘consistent with back spatter from a gunshot,’ any expert opinion testimony he would offer regarding the stains would not assist the trier of fact; and therefore, such expert opinion should be excluded because it will unfairly confuse and mislead the jury.”* |The filing added that “SLED’s HemaTrace testing results confirmed the stains are not human blood.” Thus, *“Kinsey’s testimony should be prevented because it is not relevant and could potentially result in confusing the jury.”* |

|Meanwhile, a steady trickle of local customers visited the idling food trucks.<br>Panna e Cioccolata. Mamma Mikki’s. Shorty’s Smokin’ Butts. And, of course, Tracy’s Elephant Ears.|
|*“I guess I’m gonna chalk this up to a good thing about the Murdaugh trial, but there’s better lunch options for a while,”* said Hillary Jacobs, the owner of Lowcountry Nutrition. She had strolled up Walterboro’s three-block main street to check out the brisket chili and pulled pork sammies at the Live Oak Smokehouse. As for the idea that those same food trucks at a double homicide trial made light of a serious event, Blaine Colson of Blazin’ Blaine’s Deep Fried Goodies shook his head vigorously from within the dark cavern of his truck. *“The city asked us,”* he said. Besides, according to Scott Grooms, the city’s director of tourism and downtown development, the food trucks had already proved their value by 10 a.m., when reporters started entering the courthouse to watch jury selection. *“They’ve had a good, steady business this morning,”* said Grooms, who strolled like an affable waiter among the media clusters, making sure everyone had internet, caffeine, and access to Taj Ma Stall, a high-end port-a-potty.<br> *“I’m sure online there will be some complaints. But it’s one of those things where, you know, we didn’t ask for this, but we prepared for it.”* |
| [‘Murdaugh Murders’: Latest Eleventh-Hour Defense Motion Points To Possible Murder Weapon](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/23/murdaugh-murders-latest-eleventh-hour-defense-motion-points-to-possible-murder-weapon/)|
|Gun that killed Maggie Murdaugh belonged to one of her family members … but it has yet to be recovered.<br>Greer is expected to testify that the .300 blackout cartridges fired at the murder scene *“came from the same weapon that fired .300 blackout cartridges at (a) shooting range and near the residence.”*:|
|In other words, the gun that killed Maggie Murdaugh in all likelihood belonged to someone who lived at Moselle.<br>For those of you unhip to rifle rounds,.300 blackout ammunition is preferable in some hunting and home defense situations to the AR-15’s typical chambering (5.56) because it offers increased power without the intense recoil and over-penettration associated with heavier rounds.<br>Greer is expected to further testify that *“some of the .300 blackout cartridges retrieved from the firing range and near the residents “were fired and/or loaded into, extracted and ejected by the .300 blackout rifle taken from the property.”* <br>Wait … taken from the property? So … has the state found the weapons?<br>No. At least not according to any law enforcement sources I have spoken with … (Not for lack of trying, though). In fact, the motion from Murdaugh’s lawyers made a point to note that Greer was unable to conclude that *“the .300 blackout cartridges found beside Maggie’s body were fired by the .300 blackout retrieved from the residence.”* |
|But Greer was able to conclude something significant … that .300 blackout cartridges found at the shooting range and near the residence were *“loaded into, extracted and ejected from the same firearm at some previous time.”* In other words, while prosecutors may not have the murder weapons in hand – they can point to the next best thing: That those weapons allegedly belonged to the Murdaugh’s and were used on the Murdaugh’s property on previous occasions.|
|This would tie in nicely with the prosecution’s theory of the timeline of the murders – and how that timeline wrecked Murdaugh’s so-called “ironclad” alibi. It would also dovetail nicely into one of the key witnesses in the case, who is expected to testify they saw Murdaugh *“hiding evidence”* in the aftermath of the murders at his parents home in Almeda, S.C.<br>It could also point to a potential accomplice in the crimes … or perhaps an accessory after the fact. Furthermore, the testimony Greer is expected to provide would severely undermine Murdaugh’s claim that the *“real killers”* of his wife and son were vigilantes looking to kill Paul as retribution for his involvement in a fatal 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. |

|Other signs South Carolina’s long-awaited “trial of the century” had descended on Walterboro: a crush of reporters from every conceivable outlet, food trucks parked outside to sate the masses and a list of potential witnesses so long it took the judge 12 minutes to read. The trial began with jury selection, a process that is expected to wrap up on Jan. 24.<br>Kinsey’s testimony *“is not relevant, fails to assist the trier of fact, and will only result in confusion of the pertinent issues being presented to the jury,”* Murdaugh’s lawyers wrote. |

|Prosecutors have said Murdaugh killed Maggie and Paul in a desperate attempt to engender sympathy for himself and cover up his decade-long financial crime spree before it could be exposed.<br>Dick Harpootlian, one of Murdaugh’s attorneys, said Jan. 24 that makes no sense because the state hasn’t shown Murdaugh’s bad acts were about to be uncovered, and there is no evidence Maggie or Paul were going to confront him.|
|The state’s theory is, *“he knew the jig was up, so he went home and butchered — blew the head off his son — and butchered his wife,” Harpootlian said. “There’s not one shred of evidence that there was any problem between any of them.”*[^1]|
|Murdaugh seemed more engaged in the courtroom Jan. 24, greeting potential jurors with a nod during the morning court session and fist-bumping his sister during a brief interaction in the courtroom that afternoon. His sister, Lynn Murdaugh Goette, has been identified as a potential defense witness in the case.<br>*“See you tomorrow,”* she told Murdaugh before he was escorted out of the courtroom.|

| *“Very significant piece of evidence …”* <br>Greer’s testimony – and the evidence he will testify to at trial – was the focus of an eleventh-hour defense motion filed on Monday by Murdaugh’s attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin|
|According to that motion, Greer’s testimony should have been excluded – or limited – during the upcoming trial because *“his opinion testimony does not aid the trier of fact to understand the evidence.”* S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman – who was tapped by the S.C. supreme court to handle this case back in September of 2021 – disagreed, allowing the state to admit what lead prosecutor Creighton Waters referred to as a *“very significant piece of evidence.”* Newman ruled that prosecutors had *“met the threshold”* to include both the evidence and the accompanying testimony – concluding it would *“assist the jury”* in its deliberations. He further found Greer was *“well-qualified”* to speak to the subject matter at issue. Finally, Newman rejected the defense’s contention that ballistics evidence was not an established science. *“The underlying science is solid,”* Newman said at the conclusion of a two-and-a-half hour hearing on Tuesday afternoon.|
|Murdaugh’s attorney Griffin did an admirable job pushing back against Greer’s findings, challenging him on his contention that 300 blackout cartridges fired at the murder scene *“came from the same weapon that fired .300 blackout cartridges at (a) shooting range and near the residence.”*<br>*“Are you able to state with a reasonable degree of certainty that only one weapon in the world could have made these marks?”* Griffin asked Greer.<br>Greer repeatedly referred to *“matching mechanism marks”* on the ammunition, which led him to conclude the projectiles *“came from the same firearm.”* <br> Griffin pushed back, saying Greer could be confusing the fact that ammunition from guns *“produced in the same production lots have identical markings.”*|
|Greer responded that his analysis – which was confirmed by two independent SLED analyses – was based on *“pattern matching”* that enabled him to *“distinguish and correctly identify”* the weapon from others manufactured in the same lot. As SLED agents continue searching diligently for these weapons, Greer was able to conclude something significant … that .300 blackout cartridges found at a shooting range and near the residence were *“loaded into, extracted and ejected from the same firearm at some previous time.”* <br> In other words, while prosecutors may not have the murder weapons in hand – *they can point to the next best thing: That those weapons allegedly belonged to the Murdaugh’s and were used on the Murdaugh’s property on previous occasions.* |

|The clip that caught the accused killer in a lie<br>*“There is talking, and it’s extremely playful and friendly,”* one source told Monk. *“It sounds perfectly normal, like any happy family — mother, father and child — doing something together. They are spread out, it sounds like, and they are just talking back and forth.”*<br>*“They are talking about the different game birds out there,”* Monk’s source continued. *“I think one of the dogs was chasing or caught a chicken. There’s talk of that. You can hear a little bit of laughter.”*<br>Monk acknowledged the existence of this video was first reported by our news outlet back in June, but according to him we did not at that time *“characterize the contents other than to say it showed Murdaugh and Maggie talking by the dog kennels on the Moselle estate.”*<br>In addition to his sources, Monk’s report was based on a court filing submitted by Harpootlian and attorney Jim Griffin on August 22, 2022.<br>*“On the recording, Paul is taking a video of his friend’s dog, who Paul was concerned about,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote. *“Apparently a conversation between Maggie, Paul and Alex is also captured on this recording. Family members report Maggie, Paul and Alex (were) having a convivial conversation about the behavior of their own dog, Bubba.”* <br>Harpootlian and Griffin’s description of the video as *“convivial”* (a.k.a. friendly, lively, cheerful or jovial) was key to their arguments before the court – and in the court of public opinion.<br> *“There is absolutely no indication of a disagreement or dispute between Paul, Maggie and Alex, according to family members who viewed the recording,”* the motion continued. *“However, the state contends that within minutes after this convivial, light-hearted conversation, Alex murdered both Maggie and Paul for no apparent reason.”* <br>Prior to watching the recording for the first time this week, our news outlet provided additional information on it in an article published on December 5, 2022. In that report, we noted the video was sent by Paul Murdaugh to a friend whose dog he was keeping in the kennels at Moselle. The dog – a chocolate Labrador retriever puppy belonging to Rogan Gibson – had an injured tail and Paul Murdaugh appears to have been trying to document its status for his childhood friend.<br>As I noted in the December report, while Paul was filming his friend’s puppy, one of the Murdaugh hunting dogs – Bubba – began racing around the kennels (off-camera) with a chicken in its mouth. As the three family members – including Alex Murdaugh – called out for the dog, Maggie Murdaugh speculated the animal in its mouth was a guinea, not a chicken.<br> *“Hey he’s got a bird in his mouth!”* Maggie exclaimed on the video. *“It’s a guinea.”* <br> She was quickly corrected on this point by both her husband and her son.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Alex told his wife.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Paul confirmed.<br>Alex Murdaugh is not seen on the video, but he is clearly heard correcting his wife and calling out after the dog.<br>*“Come here, Bubba!”* Murdaugh is heard yelling.<br> *“Come here, Bubba!”* <br>More than a dozen people – including Murdaugh’s own family members and former law partners – have reportedly confirmed to law enforcement that the voice on the footage belonged to him. *Which it clearly is.* |

|Evidence in the case will show Alex Murdaugh picked up a shotgun and first fired it at his son Paul, hitting his chest and shoulder, Waters said. The 22-year-old survived the initial shots, Waters said, but a third shot did *“catastrophic damage”* to his head and brain. Evidence will show he collapsed outside a feed room near dog kennels at the Murdaughs’ expansive hunting property. *“You’re going to see what he did to Maggie and Paul,”* Waters said. *“It’s going to be gruesome. There’s no other way around it.”* Moments later, Alex Murdaugh picked up an AR-style rifle and opened fire *“just feet away”* on his wife Maggie, the prosecutor said.<br>*“Pow, pow,”* Waters said, mimicking gunshots fired first toward Maggie’s legs. Additional shots struck her head, instantly killing the mother of two, the prosecutor said.|
|The Columbia trial attorney and state senator countered that his client was a loving husband and father who was incapable of inflicting the shotgun blasts that killed Paul, the 22-year-old “apple of his eye,” or the rifle shots that took down Maggie, 52.<br>Harpootlian described the scene in great and gory detail. Shot at close range, Paul’s head exploded *“like a watermelon,”* he said, describing that brain matter was sprayed all over the walls and floor of the feed room he was standing in by the property’s dog kennels. Only the front of his face was left intact, Harpootlian said.<br>Maggie was shot next as she ran away from the scene, Harpootlian said. She had fallen and was lying prone when the killer fired the fatal shot into the back of her head, the defense attorney said.<br>Harpootlian repeatedly used words like “butchered,” “slaughtered” and “executed” to describe the slayings, contrasting the horrific violence against what he described as a lack of evidence of discord in the family.<br>*“He didn’t kill — butcher — his son and wife,”* Harpootlian said.<br> Yet state investigators spent some 13 months trying to prove it, rather than pursue an objective investigation to find the real killer, Harpootlian said.<br>*“They decided that night: He did it,”* Harpootlian said. *“They’ve been pounding that square peg in that round hole.”*<br>In a twist, Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster; brothers Randy and John Marvin; sister Lynn Murdaugh Goette; and sister-in-law Liz Murdaugh appeared in court. They declined to speak with reporters outside the courthouse. But they sat in the second row behind the defendant and at times spoke with him as he turned around in his chair to face them.<br>Murdaugh’s relatives had skipped Alex Murdaugh’s prior court appearances, hoping to avoid the publicity that would surely follow.<br>Murdaugh’s lawyers have named each of them as potential witnesses in the trial. It is unclear what they might say. But their testimony would come later in the trial, if at all. |

Because the clothes he removed in at least one of these wardrobe changes have reportedly vanished without a trace, sources say … not unlike the weapons Murdaugh allegedly used to kill his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property in Colleton County on June 7, 2021.<br>News of at least one of Murdaugh’s wardrobe changes on the night of the murders was reported Wednesday afternoon by Columbia, S.C. criminal defense attorney Lori Murray – whose TikTok page has been a big hit among those tracking the ‘Murdaugh Murders‘ crime and corruption saga.<br>Murray specifically discussed clothes Murdaugh was wearing in a Snapchat video sent from Paul Murdaugh at 7:56 p.m. EDT on the night of the murders.<br>*“I think I finally know what was on the Snapchat video Paul (Murdaugh) sent to his friends at 7:56 p.m. on the night he was killed,”* Murray said in her clip. *“Alex Murdaugh can be seen on that video wearing long pants and a dress shirt – not the clothes he was seen wearing when police arrived after he called 9-1-1.”*<br>*“He changed clothes a lot that day,”* one source familiar with the status of the case told me.<br>Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters did not reference them during his opening arguments on Wednesday afternoon – in which he laid out several new details of the case agains Murdaugh.<br>Curiously, the 7:56 p.m. EDT Snapchat video was referenced by lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian in his opening statement – as purported evidence of the closeness between Alex Murdaugh and his son, whom he referred to as *“the apple of his (father’s) eye.”*<br>Harpootlian also seemed to invite scrutiny of the wardrobe changes during his opening argument when he asked jurors about the lack of physical evidence in the case.<br>*“Where are the bloody clothes?”* Harpootlian asked jurors.<br>That’s a very good question … but the fact we are having to ask it at all could wind up backfiring on Murdaugh’s attorneys in a big way if the clothes Murdaugh was wearing on the night of the murders have truly vanished.|

[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Carries First Day Of Testimony](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/26/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-carries-first-day-of-testimony/)<br>Another strong performance from prosecutor Creighton Waters as the state begins laying out its case …<br>South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century’ – the double homicide case against accused killer Alex Murdaugh – was supposed to be a legal mismatch. And through its first day of witness testimony, it has been.<br>The surprise? The mismatch we have seen isn’t the one everyone was expecting … Heading into this trial, the general consensus was that lead prosecutor Creighton Waters would be unlikely to match wits against Murdaugh’s lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian. Sure, Waters had demonstrated the ability to do so in multiple pre-trail hearings, but could he sustain it over the course of a multi-week trial? One in which the burden of proof – a.k.a. the pressure – was squarely on him and his team of prosecutors? Also, the defense entered these proceedings with significant momentum … poking what appeared to be major holes in the state’s case.<br>As the first day of testimony drew to a close, though, Waters has proven himself more than equal to the task … while Harpootlian has stumbled badly out of the gate. As a result, the murder case against Murdaugh is looking far better than it did forty-eight hours ago.<br>After delivering a thunderously effective opening statement yesterday, Waters pressed his advantage on the first day of testimony – introducing key initial evidence and eliciting compelling testimony from several first responders who arrived and discovered the initial carnage at the scene of this crime. Found at the crime scene? Five spent .300 blackout cartridges and other ballistics evidence. This evidence has become increasingly important to prosecutors in light of pre-trial problems that arose with regard to one of its blood spatter experts.<br>On Thursday, jurors saw body-worn camera footage from responding deputies along with crime scene photos from these shootings – and judging from the looks on their faces, what they saw was every bit as horrific as what was described to us in the weeks leading up to trial.<br>*“The majority of the head is gone,”*[^2] said Colleton County sheriff’s office captain Jason Chapman. *“There is substantial damage to his head … and what appears to be his brain down around his ankles,”* noted Barry McCoy of Colleton County fire and rescue during his testimony.<br>As jurors absorbed all of this information, Waters also began laying the groundwork for several narratives key to the prosecution’s case – 1) That Murdaugh immediately sought to cast blame for the murders elsewhere and 2) That he immediately began laying the groundwork for a concocted alibi.<br>In his first comments to Colleton County sergeant Daniel Greene – the first law enforcement officer to arrive on the scene – Murdaugh said that his son was the victim of vigilante justice.<br>*“This is a long story my son was in a boat crash,”* Murdaugh told Greene. *“I know that’s what (this) is.”* Murdaugh offered this same unsolicited theory in the full, unredacted 9-1-1 call that was played in court for the first time.<br>Murdaugh also encouraged Greene to check his cell phone to verify his recent movements.[^3]<br>Readers will recall Murdaugh’s attorneys boasted of him having an *“ironclad alibi”* for the night of these killings.<br>They will also recall how that alibi was shredded by the retrieval of a cell phone video taken by his son, Paul, just three minutes before he was killed. That clip placed Alex Murdaugh at the scene of the murders just moments before they took place.<br>The cell phone video also revealed Murdaugh lied to investigators about his whereabouts on the night of the murders. Prosecutors have yet to introduce this video into evidence, but Waters did reference it in his opening arguments. While Waters and his deputies – including Savanna Goude and David Fernandez – began laying the foundation for their case, Harpootlian also attempted to begin injecting his own narratives into the mix. The veteran attorney – who has five decades of courtroom experience – is clearly hoping that allegations of contaminated evidence, shoddy police work and a so-called *“rush to judgment”* on the part of prosecutors will begin creating reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors.<br>*“You are taught to keep the crime scene pristine,”* Harpootlian told Greene during his testimony. *“What I’m getting at is one of the cardinal rules of a crime scene is to keep it pristine.”* According to Harpootlian, responding officers failed to do so by walking in and around the immediate vicinity of the bodies after determining the two victims had expired – and by placing sheets over their bodies prior to crime scene technicians arriving to inspect them. Harpootlian also chided Colleton County corporal Chad McDowell – the second officer who arrived on the scene – for marking evidence without being asked to do so. *“Were y’all trying to solve the crime?”* he asked McDowell. *“What were y’all doing?”*<br>In addition to these narratives, Harpootlian is eager to advance the same *“boat crash vigilante”* theory his client tried to sell law enforcement on from the beginning.<br>If he is to be successful, he is going to have to improve on his performance in front of this jury. Harpootlian struggled to build a rhythm all day – encountering technical difficulties with courtroom audio-visual equipment, objections from Waters and his own apparent lack of organization.<br>Jurors seemed miffed by Harpootlian from the beginning, and by the time he finally began scoring a few points late in the afternoon – many looked as though they had already formed a negative opinion of him.<br>Should Harpootlian be counted out? Absolutely not … as I noted frequently on social media posts throughout the day, I fully expect him to find his rhythm as proceedings progress. |
| [Alex Murdaugh prosecutors launch case with unredacted 911 tapes, body camera footage](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/alex-murdaugh-prosecutors-launch-case-with-unredacted-911-tapes-body-camera-footage/article_3818e9d2-9d84-11ed-a44d-afa132da63de.html)<br>WALTERBORO — Alex Murdaugh was dry-eyed when officers arrived at his Colleton County hunting property the night his wife and son were shot to death, first responders testified Jan. 26 in his double-murder trial. Murdaugh also didn’t appear to be covered in blood, though he told dispatchers he had touched Maggie and Paul Murdaugh’s bodies while checking for signs of life, those officers said. Within minutes of dialing 911 to report the slayings, Murdaugh had developed a theory of why someone would brutally kill two of his closest relatives: retaliation for the fatal 2019 boat crash that first brought scrutiny to his prominent Lowcountry family. In separate conversations shortly after reporting the slayings on June 7, 2021, the prominent Hampton attorney shared that theory with both an emergency dispatcher and the first officer on scene at the Murdaughs’ estate, audio and body camera recordings showed. *“This is a long story,”* Murdaugh whimpered to the officer in a high-pitched voice. *“My son was in a boat wreck months back. He’s been getting threats. Most of it has been benign stuff we didn’t take serious. … I know that’s what it is.”* *“My son has been threatened for months and months and months,”* Murdaugh told the dispatcher minutes earlier. *“He’s been hit several times.”* Almost immediately after he told the deputy about the threats, Murdaugh offered to show the deputy his phone to prove he had just gotten home from his parents’ house.[^5]<br>State prosecutors believe the exchanges help prove their theory that the slayings of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were an elaborate ruse Murdaugh concocted to portray himself as the victim of an *“unspeakable tragedy”* and cover up his decade-long financial crime spree. Paul Murdaugh had been criminally charged with driving a family boat while intoxicated in 2019, when it crashed into a Beaufort County bridge piling. Mallory Beach, 19, died. State investigators quickly excluded Beach’s parents and the other boat crash survivors as suspects in the Murdaugh murders.<br>Tapes of Murdaugh’s conversations shortly after the slayings were among a series of records the S.C. Attorney General’s Office revealed for the first time Jan. 26 in their quest to convict Murdaugh on charges of murdering his wife and son.<br>Throughout hours of testimony, the public was not allowed to see the new footage. At times, this made the proceedings difficult to follow. Prosecutors and defense attorneys repeatedly asked witnesses questions about videos and photos presented to them, images that neither the courtroom audience nor the wider viewing public could see.<br>Prosecutors taped paper over one monitor that faced the audience, and Murdaugh’s defense propped the lid of a cardboard box another. Sometimes they did so even when they showed images that were not submitted under seal. The jury watched on screens angled away from public seating. The Colleton County courthouse does not have monitors set up for public viewing. In an order signed by Judge Clifton Newman Jan. 25, both sides agreed that graphic images from the crime scene and autopsies should be kept under seal. The deputies’ body camera footage was said to show their bodies. Yet extensive portions of the videos appeared to be recorded away from the bodies, where officers said it showed new details that could prove key to the case. For instance, deputies described how the camera footage showed multiple sets of unidentified tire tracks near the buildings where Maggie and Paul were shot. It showed Murdaugh’s behavior in the minutes after deputies arrived. And it showed the clothing he was wearing, which did not bear visible signs of blood.<br>Prosecutors began presenting their case Jan. 26 by calling six witnesses to testify about the night of the slayings. Two were dispatchers who took Murdaugh’s 911 call that evening. The county fire chief and three deputies with the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office testified about responding to the family’s 1,770-acre hunting estate, which they called Moselle. They found the bodies of Maggie Murdaugh, 52, and her 22-year-old son near dog kennels on the property. <br>Responders at the scene testified Murdaugh appeared distraught and nervous, though he wasn’t crying. Some said they didn’t view that as suspicious, as people process shock and grief differently. On Sgt. Daniel Greene’s body camera video, Murdaugh could be heard repeatedly asking if deputies had checked Maggie and Paul’s bodies and if they were really dead. At one point, he asked if their deaths were *“official.”* Greene and others testified it was obvious they were dead. A shotgun blast had blown Paul’s head apart, and his brain lay by his feet. Maggie had a hole in her head as well from a close-range, execution-style rifle shot. Both were lying facedown in large pools of blood and other matter, officers testified.<br>Paul’s injuries were *“incompatible with life,”*[^4] Colleton County Fire-Rescue Chief Barry McRoy said, explaining why he didn’t bother checking their pulses. He said Maggie’s wounds were *“not sustainable.”*<br>Murdaugh, 54, appeared emotional throughout the day. He rocked back and forth in his courtroom chair as witnesses recounted the grisly details of his wife and son’s deaths. Murdaugh’s face flushed red as tears flowed freely down his cheeks.<br>Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian seemed focused on establishing that first responders made critical blunders while securing the crime scene and establishing evidence.In cross-examination, he repeatedly asked sheriff’s deputies why they walked about the scene that night, marking shell casings and at one point stepping into the feed room where Paul was shot.<br>Any bloody footprints found at the scene could have been left by the deputies, rather than the killer, Harpootlian asserted. “You do your best not to contaminate the crime scene,”* Greene told him at one point. *“And this is your best?”* Harpootlian asked. *“To walk in an area where there is blood and brain matter?”* He noted that deputies observed multiplesets of tire impressions in the wet grass around the crime scene, but they didn’t take photos to document them and weren’t able to prevent other responders and even civilians from driving onto the scene and mooting that potential evidence. I 5Mr>*“Whatever tire tracks were left were obliterated by your men, is that correct?”* Harpootlian asked Greene.> *“That’s possible,”* the deputy responded.<br>State prosecutors countered by noting how much care first responders took to secure the scene and avoid damaging evidence. The deputies noted that at first, they had no clue whether they were walking into an active shooter situation, a murder-suicide or something else entirely.<br>*“At the time, we didn’t know what we had,”* testified Jason Chapman, a captain with the sheriff’s office.<br>Harpootlian defended his client’s behavior that evening, saying he was overcome with grief and concerned about his wife and son’s well-being.<br>He also noted that while Murdaugh didn’t appear to be covered in blood, there was blood on his shorts. Harpootlian objected when prosecutors seemed to imply that the lack of blood on Murdaugh indicated he hadn’t checked on Maggie and Paul’s pulses.<br>One piece of evidence that came through despite the restrictions on exhibits was Murdaugh’s 911 call. Jurors heard new audio that had been redacted in versions released to the media after the slayings<br>In one of the never-before-heard exchanges, Murdaugh told the dispatcher he was going up to the Moselle house to retrieve a shotgun for his own protection, not knowing whether the killer was still on the grounds<br>In another, the dispatcher asked Murdaugh if his relatives shot themselves.<br>*“Oh no!”* Murdaugh cried. *“Hell no!”*|

| [LIVE FEED – ‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial: Day Five](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/27/murdaugh-murders-trial-day-five-2/) |
| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Witnesses To Watch For …](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/27/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-witnesses-to-watch-for/) <br>The state of South Carolina is methodically making its case against Alex Murdaugh – the erstwhile influential attorney who stands accused of savagely slaying his wife and son nineteen months ago in a crime which has drawn international attention.<br>The investigation into this graphic double homicide – and multiple other lines of criminal inquiry tied to Murdaugh and his associates – is being run by the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and the office of S.C. attorney general Alan Wilson.<br>I say *“is”* because the murder investigation is ongoing … As the prosecution worked to establish its case – and as defense attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin started pushing back with their own counter-narratives – the vast majority of early witnesses have been procedural in nature.<br<After hearing from first responders – the Colleton County deputies who were called to Moselle following Alex Murdaugh’s fateful 9-1-1 call – prosecutors began questioning witnesses who collected, processed and analyzed various pieces of evidence taken from the crime scene, from autopsies of the victims and from other locations pertinent to the investigation.<brìAs proceedings wore on Friday, the state’s case – which started with a bang courtesy of lead prosecutor Creighton Waters – settled into a trudging and pedantic plodding, a halting progression of mostly abbreviated, evidence-based testimony from witnesses who were called to verify various items and confirm their chain of custody so they could be admitted into evidence.<br>One particular witness who fielded the vast majority of this evidence was special agent Melinda Worley, a forensic scientist at SLED who was part of the crime scene unit which responded to Moselle. Worley was on the stand for more than four hours as assistant attorney general Savanna Goude led her through the introduction of several dozen pieces of evidence.<br>*“There’s a lot of mechanical witnesses – I wouldn’t call them boring – but they are necessary to introduce evidence,”* a prosecutor familiar with the status of the case told me.<brì*“In order to tell a story you have to put a thousand puzzle pieces on the table,”* the prosecutor told me. *“Those pieces may not make sense when you first see them – but they’re all going to make sense when they’re tied together in a story.”*<br>*“Once you see how it all fits together, you see the full picture,”* the prosecutor added. *“But first, we’ve got to cover every last little blade of grass.”*<br>Prosecutors certainly covered plenty of real estate on Friday afternoon.<br>As Goude led Worley through this voluminous evidence, Harpootlian twirled his glasses and repeatedly rested his eyes – making no attempt to hide his boredom from jurors. As for Murdaugh, he displayed a wide range of emotions – breaking down in tears on several occasions as swabs taken from the bodies of his dead wife and son were admitted into evidence.<br>Later, though, Murdaugh was seen joking and gesturing with Harpootlian and Griffin.<brìWhile Waters laid out a timeline and touched on motive in his opening statement, so far no one has laid out the investigatory process that led the state to present probable cause affidavits seeking warrants for Murdaugh’s arrest.<br>Will that change soon<br>Yes, I am told …<br>*“You are going to see the lead investigators come in and start telling the story,”* the prosecutor told me.<br>According to my sources, the most critical witness for SLED will be Dave Owen, a senior special agent who is the lead case agent on the Murdaugh murder investigation. Another critical witness will be Ryan Neill, SLED’s Lowcountry regional captain. Neill supervises all cases in the fourteenth judicial circuit and reports directly to SLED headquarters in Columbia, S.C.<br>For those of you interested in SLED’s organizational structure, there are agents, special agents, senior special agents, lieutenants captains, majors, an assistant chief and (obviously) chief Mark Keel, who runs SLED as an appointee of South Carolina governor Henry McMaster.<br>According to my sources, the prosecution’s direct examination of Owen will take at least one full day – but unlike Friday afternoon’s mostly perfunctory testimony, it will tell a story based on the evidence already introduced.<br>*“He is going to be responsible for presenting the investigative case,”* another source familiar with Owen’s testimony told me.<br>Owen and Neill are also expected to carry the weight of rebutting Harpootlian and Griffin’s theory that the state *“rushed to judgment”* in accusing Murdaugh of these crimes.|
| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: So-Called ‘Crime Scene’ Images Revive Calls For...](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/27/murdaugh-murders-saga-so-called-crime-scene-images-revive-calls-for-transparency/) <br>Late Thursday, South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman and Colleton County court officials released a series of so-called *“crime scene”* photos taken in the aftermath of the gruesome double homicide at the heart of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.<br>Murdaugh was charged with these murders on July 14, 2022. He pleaded not guilty and asked to be judged *“by God and country.”* His trial is currently taking place in Walterboro, S.C.<br>The problem with the selective release of these “crime scene” photos? First, the handful of images released to the media do not even begin to cover the number of photos taken at the scene. Also, court officials have not released any of the body-worn camera footage which was presented in court earlier this week – redacted or otherwise.<br>Even worse, members of the media were prohibited from viewing any of this evidence in court. Lawyers literally held up banker’s boxes and taped sheets of paper over monitors to prohibit the press from seeing images or videos of the crime scene.<br>Look … I can (sort of) understand limiting media access to sensitive files, but in a courtroom that has been literally cordoned off from media phones, laptops (even Apple watches) … why are reporters not allowed to at least use their eyeballs to assess the evidence and report back to their audiences?<br>At the end of the day, isn’t that our job?Let me be clear about something: This is not about members of the media – including our news outlet – wanting to splash sensational images and video of gore and guts all over the internet. I mean, we live in a world so desensitized to the macabre I doubt most people would be overly shocked by the materials, but that is not the issue.<br>As I have said often over the course of the past week, the issue is that this is a public trial. It is being held in a public courtroom. Public prosecutors are submitting evidence which, by definition, is public information. Every solitary shred of it. This is public information. All of it. That means barring extraordinary circumstances, the public has a right to see it … even if it is graphic.<br>FITSNews has already received copies of multiple crime scene photos in this case (including some truly jarring ones). And as I noted in a previous post, we declined to publish those images.<br>Even in the event all of the graphic photos and videos are made public – as they should be – I haven’t decided how we would handle them. Certainly they would not be splashed on our homepage or directly visible in our articles, but on some level there is a public right to see these materials in some form or fashion.<br>And at the very least, if these materials are going to be sealed and hidden from the public view it becomes all the more vital for journalists inside the courtroom to be able to see these exhibits as they are presented and review them after the fact.<br>Prior to the commencement of these proceedings, I penned a column acknowledging the need for certain restrictions on media access to the courtroom. Logistically, it would have been absolutely impossible to accommodate everyone wanting to bring a camera or a livestream set-up into the court to do so.<br>Court officials were wise to designate pool photographers and a single source for the livestream.<br>But after a disappointing reversal on an initial order allowing the press to bring cell phones into court, it seems as though every day restrictions on media access to the critical components of this trial grow more draconian – like a powerful boa constrictor tightening its grip.<br>Journalists strain to see exhibits over the shoulders of attorneys during Alex Murdaugh‘s double homicide trial on January 26, 2023.<br>Again, I will admit a bit of self-interest here. More access equals more info, which equals more clicks … which equals more money. But that self-interest pales in comparison with the public interest at stake in this case, which is not only a trial of Alex Murdaugh – but of the entire South Carolina judicial system.<br>Retired law professor Jay Bender – a transparency advocate with years of experience litigating public records access cases – has been serving as a liaison between the court and the media during this trial.<br>I like Bender. And as our audience is well aware, I have written glowingly of judge Newman on multiple occasions in the past. Also, Colleton court officials like Becky Hill and her team have gone above and beyond in this trial to accommodate some big egos in and out of the courtroom. Every night after the trial is over, in fact, you can see the light in Hill’s office still burning as she and her staff work overtime to make sure things keep running smoothly.<br>But as the first week of this trial draws to a close, the fact remains the level of media access to critical information being presented in the courtroom is simply unacceptable. And has to change. |

So did his arms. And his shirt. And his shorts. And his shoes, she said.<br>Rutland, prosecutors’ seventh witness, testified she saw no blood on Murdaugh at all. Nor could she see footprints or kneeprints near Maggie or Paul’s bodies, though both were lying facedown in large pools of blood and brain matter. Later, she testified that it seemed like he’d put on fresh clothes; she noticed his shirt was clean, though he was sweating on a warm, humid night.<br>Rutland’s testimony came as prosecutors with the S.C. Attorney General’s Office sought to bolster their case that Murdaugh murdered his wife and son and then quickly worked to cover it up.<br>In the opening stages of the case, prosecutors have sought to showcase apparent inconsistencies between what Murdaugh told officials about his whereabouts and actions that evening and what investigators observed at the scene and learned afterward.<br> Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin presented a different conclusion from Rutland’s testimony. In cross-examination, he noted the crime scene was covered in blood and brains — matter that could have sprayed onto the shooter as well. Yet Rutland had testified that Murdaugh was spotless.<br>*“He didn’t look like someone who had just been within feet of blowing Paul’s head off, right?”* Griffin asked.<br>*“I can’t say that,”* Rutland replied. *“There are so many factors that you would have to take into account.”*<br>Rutland and the State Law Enforcement Division’s lead investigator, Dave Owen, spoke with Murdaugh at 12:57 a.m. in a vehicle as it rained at the family’s remote hunting lodge. They were joined by Danny Henderson, a lawyer at the family’s high-powered law firm who said he was acting as Murdaugh’s personal attorney.<br>Sitting in the front seat, Murdaugh soon broke down in tears, and Henderson reached up to put a hand on his shoulder. At three points in the roughly 30-minute interview, he opened the car door, leaned outside and appeared to spit.<br>The video shows Murdaugh present an alibi that prosecutors contend does not hold up: He woke up from a nap and decided to visit his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease, because his father had gone to the hospital that day. He told investigators he found Maggie and Paul shot dead when he arrived home.<br>But in his opening statement, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters said investigators found cellphone video placing Murdaugh with his wife and son shortly before the shootings. That video has not been shown in court.<br>In his interview with investigators, Murdaugh did not mention visiting Paul and Maggie at the dog kennels before finding their bodies.<br>He also reiterated what he had told the 911 dispatcher and first responders hours earlier: that his son Paul had received threats and even been physically attacked by people angry with him over the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach.<br>Paul had been criminally charged with driving the boat that night, Murdaugh told investigators. The drunken boating case was still pending when he was killed.<br>Agent Owen asked Murdaugh if he thought *“anybody on that boat”* had meant Paul harm.<br>*“I don’t know of any direct threats”* from the crash survivors, Murdaugh said, adding the threats came from people the Murdaughs didn’t know. Months earlier, Paul had gone out in Charleston and come home with a black eye, he said.<br>“I’ve never been prouder of him than the way he has handled the pressures and the adversity in that situation.” Murdaugh said of Paul and the boat case. *“Paul is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful kid. He’d do almost anything. He gets along with almost anybody.”*<br>Rutland’s testimony came near the end of the first week of Murdaugh’s double murder trial, a nationally televised event that has brought food trucks, network TV stars and more than 100 reporters to this lightly populated Lowcountry town.<br>Prosecutors have so far presented nine witnesses, all of whom responded in some way to Murdaugh’s frantic 911 call to report finding his wife and son’s dead bodies.<br>Paul Murdaugh was shot first with two shotgun blasts, the latter a fatal shot to the head, as he stood in a feed room by a set of dog kennels at the Murdaugh family’s 1,770-acre hunting estate in Colleton County, prosecutors have said.<br>The shooter then felled Maggie with a .300 Blackout semiautomatic assault rifle as she tried to run away. The killer fired a fatal shot to the back of her head from close range as she lay on the ground, according to evidence presented in the case.<br>State prosecutors have said Murdaugh killed Maggie and Paul in a desperate attempt to engender sympathy for himself and distract from a series of inquiries into his bank records that were about to expose his myriad financial crimes. Earlier in the day, his law firm’s chief financial officer confronted him over $792,000 in legal fees that were unaccounted for, demanding proof that it hadn’t gone missing, she testified in another case.<br>Since the slayings, state investigators have charged Murdaugh with nearly 100 other crimes, most connected to allegations he surreptitiously stole nearly $9 million from legal settlements and fees owed to his legal clients, law partners and others who trusted him.<br>At Murdaugh’s trial, which is expected to last at least three weeks, prosecutors have sought to highlight the defendant’s behavior in the hours after reporting the slayings.<br>They have unveiled body camera footage and 911 audio, stopping the tapes periodically to note moments where Murdaugh’s demeanor could be interpreted as strange.<br>First responders testified earlier this week that Murdaugh wasn’t crying when they arrived, though he did seem distraught and whimpered at times when he spoke with deputies. He eyed officers cautiously as they inspected unidentified tire tracks near the scene, one testified.<br>Murdaugh’s lawyers have countered that their client’s behavior shows only that he was traumatized and in shock at the scene.<br>Prosecutors also have fixated on where blood was found around the scene — and where it wasn’t.<br>Swabs of 10 separate areas around the driver and front passenger sides of Murdaugh’s Chevrolet Suburban — the vehicle he used to drive from the main house at the Moselle estate to the crime scene that evening — tested positive for blood, SLED crime scene technician Melinda Worley testified.<br>Worley said she also swabbed an apparent spot of blood found on the 12-gauge shotgun Murdaugh retrieved from the Moselle home for his own protection after finding Maggie and Paul’s bodies. But Worley was not asked — nor did she say — whether the sample tested positive for blood. Worley will finish testifying when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 30.<br>Griffin, one of Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, established in cross-examination that Alex Murdaugh and his relatives were cooperating with the investigation. Murdaugh, his son Buster and his brothers Randy and John Marvin Murdaugh each allowed state agents to download the contents of their phones, the state’s witnesses acknowledged.<br>Griffin said Murdaugh gave investigators *“carte blanche”* to search the Moselle home and grounds for possible evidence, regardless of the search warrant investigators obtained for the entire Moselle estate.<br>Dive teams at one point scoured ponds and waterways on the property looking for possible evidence, including the murder weapons that remain missing, Rutland testified.<br>Investigators drove around the property on all-terrain vehicles as they hunted for clues, she said.<br>SLED returned to Moselle with a search warrant on Sept. 16, 2021, investigators testified. They paid particular attention to a wood-paneled gun room on the first floor of the main house, bagging heaps of ammunition, Worley said.<br>The family kept about 20-25 guns on the property,<br>Murdaugh told investigators in his interview.<brìMurdaugh’s defense attorneys have sought to establish that investigators quickly narrowed in on Murdaugh as their first and only suspect, rather than leading an objective investigation to find the true killer.<br>Defense lawyers have asked two Colleton County sheriff’s deputies, including Rutland, about a statement issued by law enforcement shortly after the slayings indicating there was no further danger to the public — perhaps hinting a suspect had been identified already. Both said they didn’t think the statement came from their offices.<br>Griffin asked Rutland on Jan. 27 whether investigators considered Murdaugh a suspect when they first interviewed him after midnight.<br>*“That night,”* Rutland said, *“everybody was a suspect.”*<br>*“Including Alex?”* Griffin asked.<br>*“Including Alex,”* Rutland said. |

|WALTERBORO — Paul Murdaugh had been calling and texting his friend on the evening of June 7, 2021, when suddenly the youngest of Alex Murdaugh’s sons stopped responding. Paul and his friend, Rogan Gibson, had been discussing Gibson’s puppy, who was staying at the dog kennels on the Murdaugh’s 1,770-acre hunting estate. Gibson sent a text at 8:49 p.m. asking Paul to photograph the dog’s injured tail so he could ask for a vet’s opinion. Though they had talked on the phone just five minutes earlier, Paul didn’t answer. Gibson tried to call him at 9:10 p.m., then again at 9:29, and 9:42, and 9:57. He texted him “yo,” and when he didn’t respond to that either, he called one more time at 10:08. He even texted Paul’s mother, Maggie Murdaugh, asking her to have Paul call him.|
|State prosecutors say Maggie and Paul’s phones had already locked for the final time — both at 8:49 p.m. Just minutes before that, they say, a video places the family patriarch, since-disgraced Hampton attorney Alex Murdaugh, with Maggie and Paul by the kennels. Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, wouldn’t leave the scene alive. Prosecutors on Jan. 30 showed a jury screenshots of Gibson’s communications with Paul as they continued their quest to prove that Alex Murdaugh brutally shot and killed his wife and son. As Murdaugh’s double murder trial progressed into a second week, the S.C. Attorney General’s Office continued to present new witnesses and evidence. Over the past four days, prosecutors have unveiled a series of seemingly unrelated clues without explaining their significance, allowing jurors and a national viewing audience to wonder where the case is headed next. For example, at one point on Monday, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters elicited testimony that state investigators had rooted through a trash can near the crime scene and found a credit card statement on which someone had circled a $1,021.10 transaction made at Gucci.  But Waters never asked who spent that money, what it was for, who circled the expenditure, or what relevance it has to the case. Then he changed topics and never mentioned it again.|
|Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, however, have been far more direct. They spent the morning of Jan. 30 making the case that Colleton County sheriff’s deputies and State Law Enforcement Division agents contaminated the crime scene and mishandled evidence from the Murdaugh’s Colleton County estate, a hunting property the family called “Moselle.” In cross-examining SLED crime scene technician Melinda Worley, Harpootlian established investigators were unable to identify a number of footprints at the scene, in part because responders had walked all over the area. One bloody footprint in the feed room where Paul was killed turned out to belong to a member of law enforcement, Worley conceded. *“Is that preservation of the scene that your standards require?”* Harpootlian asked. *“Not exactly, no,”** Worley said. *“Not exactly,”* Harpootlian repeated. *“Should police be walking through the scene?”* *“No,”* Worley replied. With Worley on the stand, Harpootlian also floated a theory that Maggie and Paul were killed by two separate shooters. He asked what Worley made of the fact that the shotgun blasts that killed Paul appeared to be fired some distance away from the semiautomatic rifle shots that killed Maggie. *“Doesn’t this indicate to you there were two shooters?”* Harpootlian asked of the state’s ballistics analysis. *“Is it a possibility that there were two shooters?”* Worley suggested that the shooter could have moved after killing Paul and moving on to fire at Maggie. *“One explanation could be that there were two shooters,”* Harpootlian pressed. *“One explanation. Not ‘the’ explanation.”* *“Not the only one,”* Worley replied.|
|In calling their 10th witness, SLED agent Jeff Croft, prosecutors continued to lay the foundation for several key elements of their case.  Croft testified about searching the first-floor “gun room” at the Moselle estate’s main house and finding an arsenal of weaponry there. He and prosecutor Waters unboxed and presented a parade of 12-gauge shotguns and one .300 Blackout semiautomatic assault rifle — which belonged to Murdaugh’s other son, Buster - that SLED agents seized from the Moselle home. Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin objected to the gun show, arguing the guns were irrelevant since none of them were the murder weapons. But Judge Clifton Newman sided with Waters, who argued the presentation was necessary to show the exhaustiveness of the state’s investigation. Croft testified about searching the Moselle grounds and finding spent .300 Blackout shell casings by the gun room’s exterior door and on a shooting range across the street from the house. Later in the trial, an expert witness for the state is expected to testify that those older shells had markings that matched shells found by Maggie’s body, proving she was killed with a Murdaugh family rifle. Prosecutors also lay the groundwork to show Murdaugh lied to investigators about his whereabouts on the night of the slayings. Waters played for the jury a recording of Murdaugh’s June 10, 2021, interview with SLED, his second. Three days after the slayings, Murdaugh allowed investigators to download the contents of his cellphone and answered a battery of politely posed questions, sometimes breaking down into tears and hysterics. Murdaugh told investigators he had gone into his Hampton law office on June 7, 2021, but came home early that day because Paul was coming by. He did not mention that his firm’s chief financial officer confronted him earlier that day about missing legal fees. Murdaugh and his son rode around the property for at least an hour and made plans to replant some sunflowers, Murdaugh said, *“doing things we like to do out there.”* Murdaugh told investigators Maggie joined them for dinner later that evening and then went down to the dog kennels. Murdaugh said he fell asleep while watching TV, but Paul must have joined his mother. He told SLED he never went down to the kennels or saw the two of them again before leaving Moselle shortly after 9 p.m. to visit his ailing mother. *“I stayed in the house,”* Murdaugh said.|
|That recording is a problem for Murdaugh, state prosecutors say, because investigators later unlocked Paul’s phone and found a video on it that places Murdaugh with his wife and son by the dog kennels shortly before they were killed. On that video, which jurors haven’t yet seen, Murdaugh is said to be heard talking with Maggie and Paul about a dog that had taken off with a chicken in its mouth. Murdaugh’s attorneys have described it as a “convivial” conversation, hardly the kind of talk you would expect to precede a pair of violent murders. But explaining to the jury why an innocent man would lie to SLED investigators about his whereabouts is one of the great challenges facing Murdaugh’s defense team in this trial. In his interview with investigators, Murdaugh insisted his relationship with his wife was *“very good.”* "“As good as it could possibly be,”* Murdaugh said. *“I mean, you know we’ve had our issues. But wonderful.”* Murdaugh said he and Maggie *“didn’t really argue,”* except in rare instances about how long the family would stay with her parents when they visited. Then, he began crying hysterically. *“She was a great mother,”* he wailed during testimony. In the interview, investigators brought up the *“traumatic picture”* Murdaugh saw when he came upon the crime scene. He began to whimper. *“It’s just so bad,”* he said. Murdaugh’s next words, utters through sobs, were difficult to make out. Some in the courtroom heard: *“They did him so bad.”* Others heard a possible confession: *“I did him so bad.”* Waters asked Croft what he heard. *“I did him so bad,”* Croft repeated. The courtroom camera panned to Murdaugh, who appeared to mouth to his attorneys: *“That’s not what I said.”* |

[^1]: This is my theory on why Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and his son, Paul. FITSNews has reported that Alex Murdaugh routinely overdrew his personal bank account by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paul was a legal and financial liability when he was charged with BUI (boating under the influence) when he crashed the boat into a bridge piling that resulted in numerous injuries and a fatality (Mallory Beach). Maggie, according to a People magazine article reported that Maggie was shopping for divorce attorneys. Both Maggie and Paul could bring down Murdaugh’s financial house of cards. 
[^2]: Got to be a closed casket funeral. 
[^3]: It sounds like Murdaugh is *"double-dog daring"* the deputy to verify that he wasn't there.

[^5]: *"See here? There's no way that I could have been in two places at once."
