It would also dovetail nicely into one of the key witnesses in the case, who is expected to testify they saw Murdaugh *“hiding evidence”* in the aftermath of the murders at his parents home in Almeda, S.C.<br>It could also point to a potential accomplice in the crimes … or perhaps an accessory after the fact.<br>Furthermore, the testimony Greer is expected to provide would severely undermine Murdaugh’s claim that the *“real killers”* of his wife and son were vigilantes looking to kill Paul as retribution for his involvement in a fatal 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. |

The state’s theory is, *“he knew the jig was up, so he went home and butchered — blew the head off his son — and butchered his wife,”* Harpootlian said. *“There’s not one shred of evidence that there was any problem between any of them.”*<br>Murdaugh seemed more engaged in the courtroom Jan. 24, greeting potential jurors with a nod during the morning court session and fist-bumping his sister during a brief interaction in the courtroom that afternoon.

He further found Greer was *“well-qualified”* to speak to the subject matter at issue. Finally, Newman rejected the defense’s contention that ballistics evidence was not an established science.<br>*“The underlying science is solid,”* Newman said at the conclusion of a two-and-a-half hour hearing on Tuesday afternoon.<br>Murdaugh’s attorney Griffin did an admirable job pushing back against Greer’s findings, challenging him on his contention that 300 blackout cartridges fired at the murder scene *“came from the same weapon that fired .300 blackout cartridges at (a) shooting range and near the residence.”*<br>*“Are you able to state with a reasonable degree of certainty that only one weapon in the world could have made these marks?”* Griffin asked Greer.<br>Greer repeatedly referred to *“matching mechanism marks”* on the ammunition, which led him to conclude the projectiles *“came from the same firearm.”* <br> Griffin pushed back, saying Greer could be confusing the fact that ammunition from guns *“produced in the same production lots have identical markings.”*<br> Greer responded that his analysis – which was confirmed by two independent SLED analyses – was based on *“pattern matching”* that enabled him to *“distinguish and correctly identify”* the weapon from others manufactured in the same lot.<br>As SLED agents continue searching diligently for these weapons, Greer was able to conclude something significant … that .300 blackout cartridges found at a shooting range and near the residence were *“loaded into, extracted and ejected from the same firearm at some previous time.”* <br> In other words, while prosecutors may not have the murder weapons in hand – *they can point to the next best thing: That those weapons allegedly belonged to the Murdaugh’s and were used on the Murdaugh’s property on previous occasions.* |

They are spread out, it sounds like, and they are just talking back and forth.”*<br>*“They are talking about the different game birds out there,”* Monk’s source continued. *“I think one of the dogs was chasing or caught a chicken. There’s talk of that. You can hear a little bit of laughter.”*<br>Monk acknowledged the existence of this video was first reported by our news outlet back in June, but according to him we did not at that time *“characterize the contents other than to say it showed Murdaugh and Maggie talking by the dog kennels on the Moselle estate.”*<br>In addition to his sources, Monk’s report was based on a court filing submitted by Harpootlian and attorney Jim Griffin on August 22, 2022.<br>*“On the recording, Paul is taking a video of his friend’s dog, who Paul was concerned about,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote. *“Apparently a conversation between Maggie, Paul and Alex is also captured on this recording. Family members report Maggie, Paul and Alex (were) having a convivial conversation about the behavior of their own dog, Bubba.”* <br>Harpootlian and Griffin’s description of the video as *“convivial”* (a.k.a. friendly, lively, cheerful or jovial) was key to their arguments before the court – and in the court of public opinion.<br> *“There is absolutely no indication of a disagreement or dispute between Paul, Maggie and Alex, according to family members who viewed the recording,”* the motion continued. *“However, the state contends that within minutes after this convivial, light-hearted conversation, Alex murdered both Maggie and Paul for no apparent reason.”* <br>Prior to watching the recording for the first time this week, our news outlet provided additional information on it in an article published on December 5, 2022. In that report, we noted the video was sent by Paul Murdaugh to a friend whose dog he was keeping in the kennels at Moselle. The dog – a chocolate Labrador retriever puppy belonging to Rogan Gibson – had an injured tail and Paul Murdaugh appears to have been trying to document its status for his childhood friend.<br>As I noted in the December report, while Paul was filming his friend’s puppy, one of the Murdaugh hunting dogs – Bubba – began racing around the kennels (off-camera) with a chicken in its mouth. As the three family members – including Alex Murdaugh – called out for the dog, Maggie Murdaugh speculated the animal in its mouth was a guinea, not a chicken.<br> *“Hey he’s got a bird in his mouth!”* Maggie exclaimed on the video. *“It’s a guinea.”* <br> She was quickly corrected on this point by both her husband and her son.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Alex told his wife.<br>*“It’s a chicken,”* Paul confirmed.<br>Alex Murdaugh is not seen on the video, but he is clearly heard correcting his wife and calling out after the dog.<br>*“Come here, Bubba!”* Murdaugh is heard yelling.<br> *“Come here, Bubba!”* <br>More than a dozen people – including Murdaugh’s own family members and former law partners – have reportedly confirmed to law enforcement that the voice on the footage belonged to him. *Which it clearly is.* |

The 22-year-old survived the initial shots, Waters said, but a third shot did *“catastrophic damage”* to his head and brain. Evidence will show he collapsed outside a feed room near dog kennels at the Murdaughs’ expansive hunting property.<br>*“You’re going to see what he did to Maggie and Paul,”* Waters said. *“It’s going to be gruesome. There’s no other way around it.”*<br>Moments later, Alex Murdaugh picked up an AR-style rifle and opened fire *“just feet away”* on his wife Maggie, the prosecutor said.<br>*“Pow, pow,”* Waters said, mimicking gunshots fired first toward Maggie’s legs. Additional shots struck her head, instantly killing the mother of two, the prosecutor said.<br>The Columbia trial attorney and state senator countered that his client was a loving husband and father who was incapable of inflicting the shotgun blasts that killed Paul, the 22-year-old “apple of his eye,” or the rifle shots that took down Maggie, 52.<br>Harpootlian described the scene in great and gory detail. Shot at close range, Paul’s head exploded *“like a watermelon,”* he said, describing that brain matter was sprayed all over the walls and floor of the feed room he was standing in by the property’s dog kennels. Only the front of his face was left intact, Harpootlian said.<br>Maggie was shot next as she ran away from the scene, Harpootlian said. She had fallen and was lying prone when the killer fired the fatal shot into the back of her head, the defense attorney said.<br>Harpootlian repeatedly used words like “butchered,” “slaughtered” and “executed” to describe the slayings, contrasting the horrific violence against what he described as a lack of evidence of discord in the family.<br>*“He didn’t kill — butcher — his son and wife,”* Harpootlian said.<br> Yet state investigators spent some 13 months trying to prove it, rather than pursue an objective investigation to find the real killer, Harpootlian said.<br>*“They decided that night: He did it,”* Harpootlian said. *“They’ve been pounding that square peg in that round hole.”*<br>In a twist, Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster; brothers Randy and John Marvin; sister Lynn Murdaugh Goette; and sister-in-law Liz Murdaugh appeared in court. They declined to speak with reporters outside the courthouse. But they sat in the second row behind the defendant and at times spoke with him as he turned around in his chair to face them.<br>Murdaugh’s relatives had skipped Alex Murdaugh’s prior court appearances, hoping to avoid the publicity that would surely follow.<br>Murdaugh’s lawyers have named each of them as potential witnesses in the trial.

Because the clothes he removed in at least one of these wardrobe changes have reportedly vanished without a trace, sources say … not unlike the weapons Murdaugh allegedly used to kill his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and youngest son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property in Colleton County on June 7, 2021.<br>News of at least one of Murdaugh’s wardrobe changes on the night of the murders was reported Wednesday afternoon by Columbia, S.C. criminal defense attorney Lori Murray – whose TikTok page has been a big hit among those tracking the ‘Murdaugh Murders‘ crime and corruption saga.<br>Murray specifically discussed clothes Murdaugh was wearing in a Snapchat video sent from Paul Murdaugh at 7:56 p.m. EDT on the night of the murders.<br>*“I think I finally know what was on the Snapchat video Paul (Murdaugh) sent to his friends at 7:56 p.m. on the night he was killed,”* Murray said in her clip. *“Alex Murdaugh can be seen on that video wearing long pants and a dress shirt – not the clothes he was seen wearing when police arrived after he called 9-1-1.”*<br>*“He changed clothes a lot that day,”* one source familiar with the status of the case told me.<br>Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters did not reference them during his opening arguments on Wednesday afternoon – in which he laid out several new details of the case agains Murdaugh.<br>Curiously, the 7:56 p.m. EDT Snapchat video was referenced by lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian in his opening statement – as purported evidence of the closeness between Alex Murdaugh and his son, whom he referred to as *“the apple of his (father’s) eye.”*<br>Harpootlian also seemed to invite scrutiny of the wardrobe changes during his opening argument when he asked jurors about the lack of physical evidence in the case.<br>*“Where are the bloody clothes?”* Harpootlian asked jurors.<br>That’s a very good question … but the fact we are having to ask it at all could wind up backfiring on Murdaugh’s attorneys in a big way if the clothes Murdaugh was wearing on the night of the murders have truly vanished.|

[‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Prosecution Carries First Day Of Testimony](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/26/murdaugh-murders-saga-prosecution-carries-first-day-of-testimony/)<br>Another strong performance from prosecutor Creighton Waters as the state begins laying out its case …<br>South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century’ – the double homicide case against accused killer Alex Murdaugh – was supposed to be a legal mismatch. And through its first day of witness testimony, it has been.<br>The surprise? The mismatch we have seen isn’t the one everyone was expecting … Heading into this trial, the general consensus was that lead prosecutor Creighton Waters would be unlikely to match wits against Murdaugh’s lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian. Sure, Waters had demonstrated the ability to do so in multiple pre-trail hearings, but could he sustain it over the course of a multi-week trial? One in which the burden of proof – a.k.a. the pressure – was squarely on him and his team of prosecutors? Also, the defense entered these proceedings with significant momentum … poking what appeared to be major holes in the state’s case.<br>As the first day of testimony drew to a close, though, Waters has proven himself more than equal to the task … while Harpootlian has stumbled badly out of the gate. As a result, the murder case against Murdaugh is looking far better than it did forty-eight hours ago.<br>After delivering a thunderously effective opening statement yesterday, Waters pressed his advantage on the first day of testimony – introducing key initial evidence and eliciting compelling testimony from several first responders who arrived and discovered the initial carnage at the scene of this crime.<br>To recap: At approximately 8:49 p.m. EDT on June 7, 2021, state prosecutors say Murdaugh savagely dispatched his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and their younger son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, near the dog kennels on the family’s 1,700-acre hunting property – known locally as Moselle. Paul Murdaugh was hit by a pair of shotgun blasts on that fateful evening – one to the head, the other to the arm and chest. Maggie Murdaugh was killed by multiple rounds from a semi-automatic rifle around the same time her son was killed. At least two of Maggie Murdaugh’s gunshot wounds were inflicted as she was lying wounded on the ground – consistent with initial reports we received of *“execution-style”* slayings. Maggie Murdaugh’s body was found approximately thirty yards from the dog kennels where her son was murdered. Also found at the crime scene? Five spent .300 blackout cartridges and other ballistics evidence. This evidence has become increasingly important to prosecutors in light of pre-trial problems that arose with regard to one of its blood spatter experts.<br>On Thursday, jurors saw body-worn camera footage from responding deputies along with crime scene photos from these shootings – and judging from the looks on their faces, what they saw was every bit as horrific as what was described to us in the weeks leading up to trial.<br>*“The majority of the head is gone,”*[^2] said Colleton County sheriff’s office captain Jason Chapman.<br>*“There is substantial damage to his head … and what appears to be his brain down around his ankles,”* noted Barry McCoy of Colleton County fire and rescue during his testimony.<br>As jurors absorbed all of this information, Waters also began laying the groundwork for several narratives key to the prosecution’s case – 1) That Murdaugh immediately sought to cast blame for the murders elsewhere and 2) That he immediately began laying the groundwork for a concocted alibi.<br>In his first comments to Colleton County sergeant Daniel Greene – the first law enforcement officer to arrive on the scene – Murdaugh said that his son was the victim of vigilante justice.<br>*“This is a long story my son was in a boat crash,”* Murdaugh told Greene. *“I know that’s what (this) is.”* Murdaugh offered this same unsolicited theory in the full, unredacted 9-1-1 call that was played in court for the first time.<br>Murdaugh also encouraged Greene to check his cell phone to verify his recent movements.[^3]<br>Readers will recall Murdaugh’s attorneys boasted of him having an *“ironclad alibi”* for the night of these killings.<br>They will also recall how that alibi was shredded by the retrieval of a cell phone video taken by his son, Paul, just three minutes before he was killed. That clip placed Alex Murdaugh at the scene of the murders just moments before they took place.<br>The cell phone video also revealed Murdaugh lied to investigators about his whereabouts on the night of the murders. Prosecutors have yet to introduce this video into evidence, but Waters did reference it in his opening arguments. While Waters and his deputies – including Savanna Goude and David Fernandez – began laying the foundation for their case, Harpootlian also attempted to begin injecting his own narratives into the mix. The veteran attorney – who has five decades of courtroom experience – is clearly hoping that allegations of contaminated evidence, shoddy police work and a so-called *“rush to judgment”* on the part of prosecutors will begin creating reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors.<br>*“You are taught to keep the crime scene pristine,”* Harpootlian told Greene during his testimony. *“What I’m getting at is one of the cardinal rules of a crime scene is to keep it pristine.”* According to Harpootlian, responding officers failed to do so by walking in and around the immediate vicinity of the bodies after determining the two victims had expired – and by placing sheets over their bodies prior to crime scene technicians arriving to inspect them. Harpootlian also chided Colleton County corporal Chad McDowell – the second officer who arrived on the scene – for marking evidence without being asked to do so. *“Were y’all trying to solve the crime?”* he asked McDowell. *“What were y’all doing?”*<br>In addition to these narratives, Harpootlian is eager to advance the same *“boat crash vigilante”* theory his client tried to sell law enforcement on from the beginning.<br>If he is to be successful, he is going to have to improve on his performance in front of this jury. Harpootlian struggled to build a rhythm all day – encountering technical difficulties with courtroom audio-visual equipment, objections from Waters and his own apparent lack of organization.<br>Jurors seemed miffed by Harpootlian from the beginning, and by the time he finally began scoring a few points late in the afternoon – many looked as though they had already formed a negative opinion of him.<br>Should Harpootlian be counted out? Absolutely not … as I noted frequently on social media posts throughout the day, I fully expect him to find his rhythm as proceedings progress. |

Murdaugh also didn’t appear to be covered in blood, though he told dispatchers he had touched Maggie and Paul Murdaugh’s bodies while checking for signs of life, those officers said. Within minutes of dialing 911 to report the slayings, Murdaugh had developed a theory of why someone would brutally kill two of his closest relatives: retaliation for the fatal 2019 boat crash that first brought scrutiny to his prominent Lowcountry family. In separate conversations shortly after reporting the slayings on June 7, 2021, the prominent Hampton attorney shared that theory with both an emergency dispatcher and the first officer on scene at the Murdaughs’ estate, audio and body camera recordings showed. *“This is a long story,”* Murdaugh whimpered to the officer in a high-pitched voice. *“My son was in a boat wreck months back. He’s been getting threats. Most of it has been benign stuff we didn’t take serious. … I know that’s what it is.”* *“My son has been threatened for months and months and months,”* Murdaugh told the dispatcher minutes earlier. *“He’s been hit several times.”* Almost immediately after he told the deputy about the threats, Murdaugh offered to show the deputy his phone to prove he had just gotten home from his parents’ house.[^5]<br>State prosecutors believe the exchanges help prove their theory that the slayings of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were an elaborate ruse Murdaugh concocted to portray himself as the victim of an *“unspeakable tragedy”* and cover up his decade-long financial crime spree. Paul Murdaugh had been criminally charged with driving a family boat while intoxicated in 2019, when it crashed into a Beaufort County bridge piling. Mallory Beach, 19, died. State investigators quickly excluded Beach’s parents and the other boat crash survivors as suspects in the Murdaugh murders.<br>Tapes of Murdaugh’s conversations shortly after the slayings were among a series of records the S.C. Attorney General’s Office revealed for the first time Jan. 26 in their quest to convict Murdaugh on charges of murdering his wife and son.<br>Throughout hours of testimony, the public was not allowed to see the new footage. At times, this made the proceedings difficult to follow. Prosecutors and defense attorneys repeatedly asked witnesses questions about videos and photos presented to them, images that neither the courtroom audience nor the wider viewing public could see.<br>Prosecutors taped paper over one monitor that faced the audience, and Murdaugh’s defense propped the lid of a cardboard box another. Sometimes they did so even when they showed images that were not submitted under seal. The jury watched on screens angled away from public seating. The Colleton County courthouse does not have monitors set up for public viewing. In an order signed by Judge Clifton Newman Jan. 25, both sides agreed that graphic images from the crime scene and autopsies should be kept under seal. The deputies’ body camera footage was said to show their bodies. Yet extensive portions of the videos appeared to be recorded away from the bodies, where officers said it showed new details that could prove key to the case. For instance, deputies described how the camera footage showed multiple sets of unidentified tire tracks near the buildings where Maggie and Paul were shot. It showed Murdaugh’s behavior in the minutes after deputies arrived. And it showed the clothing he was wearing, which did not bear visible signs of blood.<br>Prosecutors began presenting their case Jan. 26 by calling six witnesses to testify about the night of the slayings. Two were dispatchers who took Murdaugh’s 911 call that evening. The county fire chief and three deputies with the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office testified about responding to the family’s 1,770-acre hunting estate, which they called Moselle. They found the bodies of Maggie Murdaugh, 52, and her 22-year-old son near dog kennels on the property. <br>Responders at the scene testified Murdaugh appeared distraught and nervous, though he wasn’t crying. Some said they didn’t view that as suspicious, as people process shock and grief differently. On Sgt. Daniel Greene’s body camera video, Murdaugh could be heard repeatedly asking if deputies had checked Maggie and Paul’s bodies and if they were really dead. At one point, he asked if their deaths were *“official.”* Greene and others testified it was obvious they were dead. A shotgun blast had blown Paul’s head apart, and his brain lay by his feet. Maggie had a hole in her head as well from a close-range, execution-style rifle shot. Both were lying facedown in large pools of blood and other matter, officers testified.<br>Paul’s injuries were *“incompatible with life,”*[^4] Colleton County Fire-Rescue Chief Barry McRoy said, explaining why he didn’t bother checking their pulses. He said Maggie’s wounds were *“not sustainable.”*<br>Murdaugh, 54, appeared emotional throughout the day. He rocked back and forth in his courtroom chair as witnesses recounted the grisly details of his wife and son’s deaths. Murdaugh’s face flushed red as tears flowed freely down his cheeks.<br>Murdaugh defense attorney Dick Harpootlian seemed focused on establishing that first responders made critical blunders while securing the crime scene and establishing evidence.In cross-examination, he repeatedly asked sheriff’s deputies why they walked about the scene that night, marking shell casings and at one point stepping into the feed room where Paul was shot.<br>Any bloody footprints found at the scene could have been left by the deputies, rather than the killer, Harpootlian asserted. “You do your best not to contaminate the crime scene,”* Greene told him at one point. *“And this is your best?”* Harpootlian asked. *“To walk in an area where there is blood and brain matter?”* He noted that deputies observed multiplesets of tire impressions in the wet grass around the crime scene, but they didn’t take photos to document them and weren’t able to prevent other responders and even civilians from driving onto the scene and mooting that potential evidence. I 5Mr>*“Whatever tire tracks were left were obliterated by your men, is that correct?”* Harpootlian asked Greene.> *“That’s possible,”* the deputy responded.<br>State prosecutors countered by noting how much care first responders took to secure the scene and avoid damaging evidence. The deputies noted that at first, they had no clue whether they were walking into an active shooter situation, a murder-suicide or something else entirely.<br>*“At the time, we didn’t know what we had,”* testified Jason Chapman, a captain with the sheriff’s office.<br>Harpootlian defended his client’s behavior that evening, saying he was overcome with grief and concerned about his wife and son’s well-being.<br>He also noted that while Murdaugh didn’t appear to be covered in blood, there was blood on his shorts. Harpootlian objected when prosecutors seemed to imply that the lack of blood on Murdaugh indicated he hadn’t checked on Maggie and Paul’s pulses.<br>One piece of evidence that came through despite the restrictions on exhibits was Murdaugh’s 911 call. Jurors heard new audio that had been redacted in versions released to the media after the slayings<br>In one of the never-before-heard exchanges, Murdaugh told the dispatcher he was going up to the Moselle house to retrieve a shotgun for his own protection, not knowing whether the killer was still on the grounds<br>In another, the dispatcher asked Murdaugh if his relatives shot themselves.<br>*“Oh no!”* Murdaugh cried. *“Hell no!”*|
  
[^1]: This is my theory on why Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and his son, Paul. FITSNews has reported that Alex Murdaugh routinely overdrew his personal bank account by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paul was a legal and financial liability when he was charged with BUI (boating under the influence) when he crashed the boat into a bridge piling that resulted in numerous injuries and a fatality (Mallory Beach). Maggie, according to a People magazine article reported that Maggie was shopping for divorce attorneys. Both Maggie and Paul could bring down Murdaugh’s financial house of cards.

[^3]: It sounds like Murdaugh is *"double-dog daring"* the deputy to verify that he wasn't there.
