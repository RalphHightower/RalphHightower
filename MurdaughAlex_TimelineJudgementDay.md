Mamma Mikki’s. Shorty’s Smokin’ Butts. And, of course, Tracy’s Elephant Ears.<br>*“I guess I’m gonna chalk this up to a good thing about the Murdaugh trial, but there’s better lunch options for a while,”* said Hillary Jacobs, the owner of Lowcountry Nutrition. She had strolled up Walterboro’s three-block main street to check out the brisket chili and pulled pork sammies at the Live Oak Smokehouse.<br>As for the idea that those same food trucks at a double homicide trial made light of a serious event, Blaine Colson of Blazin’ Blaine’s Deep Fried Goodies shook his head vigorously from within the dark cavern of his truck. *“The city asked us,”* he said.<br>Besides, according to Scott Grooms, the city’s director of tourism and downtown development, the food trucks had already proved their value by 10 a.m., when reporters started entering the courthouse to watch jury selection.<br>*“They’ve had a good, steady business this morning,”* said Grooms, who strolled like an affable waiter among the media clusters, making sure everyone had internet, caffeine, and access to Taj Ma Stall, a high-end port-a-potty.<br> *“I’m sure online there will be some complaints. But it’s one of those things where, you know, we didn’t ask for this, but we prepared for it.”* |

It would also dovetail nicely into one of the key witnesses in the case, who is expected to testify they saw Murdaugh *“hiding evidence”* in the aftermath of the murders at his parents home in Almeda, S.C.<br>It could also point to a potential accomplice in the crimes … or perhaps an accessory after the fact.<br>Furthermore, the testimony Greer is expected to provide would severely undermine Murdaugh’s claim that the *“real killers”* of his wife and son were vigilantes looking to kill Paul as retribution for his involvement in a fatal 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. |
