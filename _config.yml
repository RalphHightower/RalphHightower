# jekyll-seo-tag
# Jekyll SEO Tag adds the following meta tags to your site:
# • Page title, with site title or description appended
# • Page description
# • Canonical URL
# • Next and previous URLs on paginated pages
# • [JSON-LD - JSON for Linking Data](https://json-ld.org/) data format from [Intro to How Structured Data Markup Works | Google Search Central  |  Documentation  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data)

# jekyll-sitemap
# <lastmod> tag
# The <lastmod> tag in the sitemap.xml will reflect by priority:
# 1. The modified date of the file as reported by the filesystem if you have jekyll-last-modified-at plugin installed (not compatible with GitHub Pages auto building)
# 2. A personalised date if you add the variable last_modified_at: with a date in the Front Matter
# 3. The creation date of your post (corresponding to the post.date variable)

# Layouts
# Refers to files within the _layouts directory, that define the markup for your theme.
# • base.html — The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their contents into this file at the line that says {{ content }} and are linked to this file via # • FrontMatter declaration layout: base.
# • home.html — The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page. [More Info.]
# • page.html — The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts.
# • post.html — The layout for your posts.
# • Base Layout
# • From Minima v3 onwards, the base layout is named base.html instead of default.html to avoid confusing new users into assuming that name holds special status.

#  enabled: true
#  strip_title: true
#  collections: true

# Optional. The default date format is used if none is specified in the tag.
