*Warning: this piece contains spoilers for the Dune book series.*

Ever since Frank Herbert released his seminal sci-fi novel Dune in 1965, readers have been consumed by the expansive and complex political wranglings of his influential stories. While Herbert only wrote six Dune novels while he was alive, since his death, his son Brian Herbert and bestselling author Kevin J. Anderson have authored many new canon Dune stories. In fact, the series is currently at an astounding 23 novels and counting; spanning 15,000 years. If you're wondering where to start and how you're supposed to read them, we're here to help.

| Title/Author(s) |
|---|
| **The Butlerian Jihad by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Despite being written decades after the original Dune, Herbert and Anderson use this prequel — the first in a trilogy — to establish and expand on much of the world building and lore from the original. Chronologically this novel takes place earliest in the Dune canon around 10,000 years before the events of Herbert's original novel. Setting up the feudal and technologically-barren world of the books, this story follows the beginnings of a brutal world-changing war between the last free humans and the artificial intelligence and robotics they created. |
| **The Machine Crusade by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|In the second book in Herbert and Anderson's trilogy, readers get to meet more vital players in the wider world of Dune. As the war rages on, readers spend time with ancestors of House Atreides and House Harkonnen while the humans continue their battle with the evil sentient computer overlord Ominus. Dense worldbuilding and intricate plotting fill the pages of this book which builds on what's come before while setting the stage for an epic final battle. |
| **The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
Set 100 years after the events at the beginning of The Butlerian Jihad, the book finds Ominus' plan for universal domination moving ever closer to success. As the most gruesome era of the war begins, history is made. Ominus' dangerous games push the universe to breaking point as each planet does what it must to survive. Establishing much of the status quo of the original book, this entry vitally introduces the battle ready iteration of the Fremen Paul meets in Dune. |
| **Sisterhood of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|The next chronological step in Herbert and Anderson's trilogies is the "Schools of Dune." After another large time jump—this time 83 years—the story focuses on a burgeoning world without the so-called "thinking machines" and how that impacts the universe. Following disparate characters as they venture around the galaxy, there are important reveals about the growing Butlerian movement, and the dangerous violence that's thrumming across the universe. |
| **Mentats of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|With the thinking machines all but destroyed a school is established to train "Mentats" humans of supreme intelligence who can essentially replace the machines the war demolished. Other academies are being founded too including a new school of the sisterhood on Wallach IX. But within their ranks is a young woman desperate for vengeance who could bring down everything. As the schools battle for survival, so does the universe as the Butlerian fanatics rise. |
| **Navigators of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Continuing the origin of the Bene Gesserit, Mentat and Suk Schools, this final book in this trilogy focuses on the ever-growing threat of the anti-technology forces who were inspired by the Butlerian Jihad. Can reason win out against the ever growing fanaticism spreading across the universe? That's the big question as Herbert and Anderson build on this growing chasm.|
| **House Atreides by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Finally gaining on the original Dune novels, the first book in the Prelude to Dune trilogy takes place just 35 years before they begin. Complex threads come together as we get introductions to some major players like Leto Atredis, Duncan Idaho, Baron Harkonnen, and the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. Political shenanigans are at a high here as games are played, loyalty is sought, and the stage is set for an epic battle that will change the universe.|
| **House Harkonnen by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Continuing the Prelude trilogy this novel continues to establish the drama and scheming that lays the groundwork for the original Dune novels. As Houses Harkonnen and Atredis struggle for power, the Bene Gesserit begin to plot towards their ultimate aim: creating the chosen one known as the Kwisatz Haderach, by introducing Leto to his concubine Jessica. So if you've always wanted to know what led to the events of Herbert's beloved books, here's your answer.|
| **House Corrino by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Topping off the Prelude trilogy is this action-packed novel that centers around Leto, Jessica, and their soon to be born son Paul. As the parents eagerly await their new arrival, the witches of the Bene Gesserit couldn't be more excited as they know their chosen one is on the way. But if you've read the Dune books you'll know they might be less than happy with the result. |
| **Princess of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Telling the stories of the two women in Paul Atredis' life, this companion novel focuses on the wife he was forced to marry, Irulan, and the woman he fell in love with on his adventures, Chani. Their dueling stories drive forward this book that gives an expansive look at the women around Paul and how their lives and experiences led them to him for better or for worse. |
| **The Duke of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|The final new trilogy before we reach Herbert's first Dune novel, the Caldan stories center around Paul's father Leto Atreides and his rise to power in the universe. Through honesty, action, and integrity, Duke Leto finds himself with ever more power and status in the political center of the galaxy, but his new status sets him on a dangerous and ultimately fatal course. |
| **The Lady of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|When Lady Jessica betrayed the Bene Gesserit her life was changed forever, in this book we see how that choice and its fallout changed the shape of the universe. When pitted against the ancient order how can one woman — and her love for her family — ever win? And what lengths will she have to go in order to make the ultimate choice and more pressingly to survive? |
| **The Heir of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|As this trilogy comes to an end it centers on the rise of Paul Atriedes better known to the universe as Muad’Dib. But he has yet to take on that title here and instead must go on a journey to find himself and the strength to lead. If you've made it this far then you're about to be rewarded by reading the original novel that started it all...|
| **Frank Herbert's Dune** |
|The book that sparked it all, Herbert's soft sci-fi introduced readers to House Atreides and their young son Pual as they embark on a quest to control and run the wealthy Spice trade on the arid planet Arrakis. Focusing on the interplanetary politics and expansive planetary landscape of his world, Dune is an exceptionally dense read but it's essential to understand the scope of Herbert's creation. While it was obviously the first published Dune book, since Herbert and Anderson's many prequels, it now hits somewhere in the middle of the reading list. |
| **Paul of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Acting as both a prequel and sequel to Dune, this story follows Paul Atreidis before and after the events of the book. As a young child he's entangled in the dangerous politics of the universe as they prepare for his father's wedding. When we join him after Dune we learn more about his time with the Fremen and his relationship with his lover Chani as the pair build a life together. |
| **Frank Herbert's Dune Messiah** |
|Speaking of Paul Atreidis, he's at the center of Herbert's second book where we join him a decade after becoming Emperor. After taking on the mantle of Messiah to the Fremen Paul has unintentionally inspired another universal Jihad, creating havoc and war across galaxies. Thanks to his visions Paul hopes to change the dire future he's created but it won't be easy. |
| **The Winds of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|With Paul lost in the deserts and thought to be dead this book builds in the time between Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. Catching up with Paul's mother Jessica, her daughter and Emperor Regent Alia, and Duncan Idaho, this is a galaxy spanning adventure that adds context and history to the original writings of Herbert while introducing important lore and worldbuilding. |
| **Frank Herbert's Children of Dune** |
|As the ecological landscape of Arrakis changes drastically so does the shape of the universe. Paul of Atreidis young children Leto and Ghanima deal with his legacy in Herbert's third book as they battle against their fates and wonder whether they'll end up just like their dad. The Spice trade comes under threat from an unexpected source and a new leader emerges. |
| **Frank Herbert's God-Emperor of Dune** |
|After the shocking events of the last book we join Leto 3500 years later. How is he almost 4000 years old? Well he merged with a Sandworm in Children of Dune and has since been ruling the universe with an iron fist and brutal regime. This novel follows Leto and inspects his impact on the cosmos as he attempts to keep his rule and hold on the Spice trade no matter what. |
| **Frank Herbert's Heretics of Dune** |
|Get ready for another time jump! This time we're visiting Arrakis 1500 years after the death of God Emperor Leto. Humanity is burgeoning once again and Sandworms have made a resurgence. Three new civilisations reign, including the Bene Gesserit who are struck with a near impossible choice: keep their behind the scenes role as master manipulators of the universe or become true leaders to make the most of the power vacuum in the universe. |
| **Frank Herbert's Chapterhouse: Dune** |
|Finding themselves in a brutal battle with another Matriarchal organization, the Honored Matres, the Bene Gesserit become entangled in a war for survival against their violent foes. This was Herbert's final book and ends on a famous cliffhanger which he was never able to resolve as he died after its publication. But his son and collaborator Anderson would later continue the story. |
| **Hunters of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|The first of a duology that adapts notes left by Herbert for what was planned for Dune 7. Continuing the story from Herbert's books this title explores the fallout from the war between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, as well as the return of the many, many descendants of the humans who were scattered across the universe during the reign of God Emperor Leto.|
| **Sandworms of Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson** |
|Filled with clones, shocking returns, and a huge reveal about the antagonists of the series, this is an event level book that brings together the many loose threads left by the original books. Combining a complex structure, multiple character arcs, and an epic final battle this is a true climax to the overarching Dune series, which has been evolving and growing since 1967.|
