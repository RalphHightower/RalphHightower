# [Hooter Restaurants Visited](https://www.hooters.com)

While working at [NCR](https://www.ncr.com) E&M-Columbia[^1], it was a Friday tradition that Customer Support would meet at the Hooters[^2] on Broad River Road for Happy Hour.

While working in the landlocked state of Iowa, I wanted some raw oysters. When I passed by the [Red Lobster](https://www.redlobster.com/) in Cedar Rapids, the line was always out the door. But I remembered that the one in Cayce, South Carolina, quit serving raw oysters. I logged into [CompuServe](https://www.compuserve.com/) had a Hooters. While in Cedar Rapids, I wanted to visit [The Mall of Americap](https://www.mallofamerica.com/), so I drove my van up there with a few fellow contractors. One of the crazier things that I did was drive to Omaha for lunch, and then drive to Kansas City for dinner. I tried to find a motel to rest a night, but there were no vacancies; I ended up having to drive back to Cedar Rapids putting 900 miles on the van that weekend.
