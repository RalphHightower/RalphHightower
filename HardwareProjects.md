| [AiryFi Hardware](https://github.com/sbcshop/AiryFi_Hardware) | About AiryFi is an open-source portable sensor that can deliver the quantity and mass of suspended particulates. It includes a PMSA003 sensor that uses a digital output with a 5V working voltage to offer information on suspended particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10) in the air per unit volume. |

| [The LoRa Kit - LONG RANGE Wireless Communication for Arduino](https://www.engineeringshock.com/lora-kit-project-page.html)  | |
| [The RedReactor](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor) |With ultra-low stand-by power, and seamless transition even at high currents between the battery and external power, it ensures your data is safe and your design just keeps on working.|
| [Red Reactor Node-RED Dashboard](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_NodeRED) | We're pleased to announce the release of our Node-RED Home Automation Dashboard, which connects to our RR_MQTT client and gives you full visibility and control of your Red Reactor enabled Pi system. |
| [Red Reactor MQTT Client for Home Automation](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_MQTT) | This Red Reactor MQTT Client is designed to run as a background application to monitor the battery. |
| [Remote Monitoring Feature for the Red Reactor](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_WebMonitor) | The Red Reactor now provides a remote monitoring feature that enables you to see the status information at a glance from your web-browser. |
| [RR Battery Monitor Background App](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_BatMonitor) | This Red Reactor Battery Monitor Background App is an application designed for systems without a display ('Headless'), or are remotely located, or just need to run largely un-attended. |
| [StarFiveTech VisionFive2 SDK](https://github.com/starfive-tech/VisionFive2) | Builds a complete RISC-V cross-compile toolchain for the StarFiveTech JH7110 SoC. It also builds U-boot SPL, U-boot and a flattened image tree (FIT) image with a Opensbi binary, linux kernel, device tree, ramdisk image and rootfs image for the JH7110 VisionFive2 board. |
| [Linux kernel for StarFive's JH7100 RISC-V SoC](https://github.com/starfive-tech/linux) |The JH7100 is a Linux-capable dual-core 64bit RISC-V SoC and this tree is meant to collect all the in-development patches for running Linux on boards using this. So far there are two such boards and both are supported by this tree.|
