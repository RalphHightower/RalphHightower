## Backed Kickstarter Projects

| Kickstarter Projects | Purpose |
|----------------------|------|
| [AiryFi Hardware](https://github.com/sbcshop/AiryFi_Hardware) | About AiryFi is an open-source portable sensor that can deliver the quantity and mass of suspended particulates. It includes a PMSA003 sensor that uses a digital output with a 5V working voltage to offer information on suspended particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10) in the air per unit volume. |

| [The LoRa Kit - LONG RANGE Wireless Communication for Arduino](https://www.engineeringshock.com/lora-kit-project-page.html)  | |
| [The RedReactor](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor) |With ultra-low stand-by power, and seamless transition even at high currents between the battery and external power, it ensures your data is safe and your design just keeps on working.|
| [Red Reactor Node-RED Dashboard](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_NodeRED) | We're pleased to announce the release of our Node-RED Home Automation Dashboard, which connects to our RR_MQTT client and gives you full visibility and control of your Red Reactor enabled Pi system. |
| [Red Reactor MQTT Client for Home Automation](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_MQTT) | This Red Reactor MQTT Client is designed to run as a background application to monitor the battery. |
| [Remote Monitoring Feature for the Red Reactor](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_WebMonitor) | The Red Reactor now provides a remote monitoring feature that enables you to see the status information at a glance from your web-browser. |
| [RR Battery Monitor Background App](https://github.com/Scally-H/RedReactor/tree/main/RR_BatMonitor) | This Red Reactor Battery Monitor Background App is an application designed for systems without a display ('Headless'), or are remotely located, or just need to run largely un-attended. |
| [RS485 CAN HAT For Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/sbcshop/RS485-CAN-HAT) | RS485 CAN HAT is a multi node communication module, to communicate with devices in a long-range, designed dedicatedly for Raspberry Pi with an operating voltage of 3.3 V, CAN controller MCP2515 via SPI interface, onboard transceiver SN65HVD230 that is controlled via UART. It is built to support automatic TX/RX control without programming. It performs half-duplex communication and it has an onboard transceiver SP3485. |
| [StarFiveTech VisionFive2 SDK](https://github.com/starfive-tech/VisionFive2) | Builds a complete RISC-V cross-compile toolchain for the StarFiveTech JH7110 SoC. It also builds U-boot SPL, U-boot and a flattened image tree (FIT) image with a Opensbi binary, linux kernel, device tree, ramdisk image and rootfs image for the JH7110 VisionFive2 board. |
| [Linux kernel for StarFive's JH7100 RISC-V SoC](https://github.com/starfive-tech/linux) |The JH7100 is a Linux-capable dual-core 64bit RISC-V SoC and this tree is meant to collect all the in-development patches for running Linux on boards using this. So far there are two such boards and both are supported by this tree.|
