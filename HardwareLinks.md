## DIY CubeSat

| [AmbaSat Sensor Add-ons]() | Function |
|---|-----|
| ~~Sensor 01: SHT30-DIS-F2.5KS~~ | Humidity and Temperature – Best in class Humidity & Temperature Sensor. Fully calibrated, linearized, and temperature-compensated digital output with a wide supply voltage range, I2C Interface with communication speeds up to 1MHz and two user-selectable addresses. Typical accuracy of 1.5 %RH and 0.1 °C. Very fast start-up and measurement time. All in a tiny 8-Pin DFN package. |
| ~~Sensor 02: STS21~~ | Temperature – A 3x3mm, fully calibrated digital temperature sensor with impressive performance. The temperature sensor features a I²C address and comes with outstanding accuracy and low power consumption. |
| Sensor 03: BME680 | Gas, Pressure, Temp & Humidity – a low power gas, pressure, temperature & humidity sensor. It is a 4-in-1 multi-functional MEMS environmental sensor which integrates VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor and barometer. Monitor 4 environmental parameters simultaneously. Widely used in environmental monitoring, home automation and control, Internet of Things (IoT) wearable device, GPS, etc. |
| Sensor 04: OPT3001DNPT | Ambient Light Sensor – The OPT3001 is a sensor that measures the intensity of visible light. The spectral response of the sensor closely matches the photopic response of the human eye, with infrared rejection. It is a single-chip lux meter, measuring the intensity of light as visible by the human eye.  The precision spectral response and strong IR rejection of the device enables the OPT3001 to accurately meter the intensity of light as seen by the human eye regardless of light source. |
| ~~Sensor 05: ZMOD4410AI1V~~ | TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds) – Designed for detecting total volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The ZMOD4410 is a 12-pin LGA assembly (3.0 x 3.0 x 0.7 mm) that consists of a gas sense element and a CMOS signal conditioning IC. The module’s sense element consists of heater element on a Si-based MEMS structure and a metal oxide (MOx) chemiresistor. The signal conditioner controls the sensor temperature and measures the MOx conductivity, which is a function of the gas concentration. |
| Sensor 06: SI1132-A10-GMR | UV Sensor – The Si1132 is a low-power, ultraviolet (UV) index, and ambient light sensor with I2C digital interface and programmable-event interrupt output. This sensor IC includes an analog-to-digital converter, integrated high-sensitivity visible and infrared photodiodes, and a digital signal processor. The Si1132 offers excellent performance under a wide dynamic range and a variety of light sources including direct sunlight. |
| Sensor 07: CCS811B-JOPD500 | TVOC & CO2 – The CCS811 is an ultra-low power digital gas sensor solution which integrates a metal oxide (MOX) gas sensor to detect a wide range of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and includes an Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC), and an I²C interface. Supporting intelligent algorithms to process raw sensor measurements and output equivalent total VOC (eTVOC) and equivalent CO2 (eCO2) values. |
| Sensor 08: TESEO-LIV3R[^2] |GPS – The Teseo-LIV3R module is an easy to use Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) standalone positioning receiver IC working simultaneously on multiple constellations. This certified module comes with optimized RF, embedded firmware and is compact at only 9.7×10.1 mm. Supporting GPS, Glonass, BeiDou & QZSS positioning systems. |
