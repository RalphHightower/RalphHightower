[^21]: I have coveted the [Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.chevrolet.com/performance/corvette) since it was redesigned in 1968. To say that the current iteration of the eighth generation of the Corvette is the top car on my car bucket 🪣 list is an understatement. 
[^22]: A mid-60's El Camino is on my car bucket 🪣 list. I drove a '66 from high school through college. After marriage to Paula, we have owned a few current year El Caminos, also including a used '65 *(since it had a manual transmission, Paula was unable to drive it)*.
[^23]: I loved the retro styling of the HHR, and it had enough cargo capacity (with the rear seats down) for us and our three Beagles. Unfortunately, I totalled my 2009 *(bought new)* in 2016, and Paula totalled the 2011 *(bought used in 2016)* in 2022.
