Celestron's set of three Vibration Suppression Pads reduce the time the scope resonates with vibration by nearly 100%, and also decrease the amplitude of the vibrations.<br /><br />To make the notion simpler to understand, imagine two identical scope setups adjacent to one another with both having a laser pointer affixed at a wall some distance away from the scopes.  Were you to influence both scopes with an identical vibration-causing shock, the laser beam originating from the scope with the Celestron Vibration Suppression Pads underneath would both move a shorter distance upon the wall and come to rest much quicker than the beam originating from the scope without the device installed.  They really work!<br /><br />The pads fit between the bottom of the tripod legs and the ground, a simple and functional solution to the problem of image disturbance.  They work on most any surface: grass, dirt, concrete, asphalt & wood.  Suitable for both telescopes and spotting scopes | $58.73 | Buy | [B&H, NYC, NY](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/) |

[^41]: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) Do not, as one of my Facebook friends characterized your big **WTF** systemwide of removing content for no reason at all, *"Facebook! You're drunk!"* ***I ain't selling anything! The equipment listed are:<br />1) Items that I own, and am not going to part with, i.e., sell;<br />2) Items that I am considering for purchasing;<br />3) Items that I am going to rent.***
[^42]: Rent if going for high megapixel range 45MP
[^43]: Choose one if using DSLR 5D III
[^44]: Choose one if using mirrorless R5
[^45]: Hydrogen Alpha Filter.
[^46]: DayStar Hydrogen Alpha Filter needed accessories:
[^47]: Choose just one dark cloth.
[^48]: Setting up for the August 2017 Total Solar Eclipse, I couldn't locate the sun using the camera's viewfinder since the sun was so danged bright. I ended up draping a windbreaker over the camera (not the lens) to block out the sunlight. This dark cloth, typically used for focusing 4×5 to 8×10 view cameras, will be handy. It's silver on one side to reflect the light and heat, and black on the other side to block out the brightness of the sun, and the surrounding area. 
[^49]: Choose just one tracking configuration.
[^50]: If Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer Motorized Mount Astro Package S20420 is chosen, purchase these items also.
[^51]: If Celestron Advanced VX GoTo German Equatorial Mount is chosen, purchase these items also.
[^52]: If iOptron SkyGuider Pro EQ Camera Mount is chosen, select these items also.
[^53]: Choose just one software controller.
[^54]: Canon super telephoto lenses that have drop-in filters do not have front filter threads. Use the outside diameter (O.D.) to determine the diameter for the slip-on filter.
