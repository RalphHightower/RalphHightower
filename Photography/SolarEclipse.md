Celestron's set of three Vibration Suppression Pads reduce the time the scope resonates with vibration by nearly 100%, and also decrease the amplitude of the vibrations.<br /><br />To make the notion simpler to understand, imagine two identical scope setups adjacent to one another with both having a laser pointer affixed at a wall some distance away from the scopes.  Were you to influence both scopes with an identical vibration-causing shock, the laser beam originating from the scope with the Celestron Vibration Suppression Pads underneath would both move a shorter distance upon the wall and come to rest much quicker than the beam originating from the scope without the device installed.  They really work!<br /><br />The pads fit between the bottom of the tripod legs and the ground, a simple and functional solution to the problem of image disturbance.  They work on most any surface: grass, dirt, concrete, asphalt & wood.  Suitable for both telescopes and spotting scopes | $58.73 | Buy | [B&H, NYC, NY](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/) |

[^56]: Choose just one dark cloth.
[^57]: Setting up for the August 2017 Total Solar Eclipse, I couldn't locate the sun using the camera's viewfinder since the sun was so danged bright. I ended up draping a windbreaker over the camera (not the lens) to block out the sunlight. This dark cloth, typically used for focusing 4×5 to 8×10 view cameras, will be handy. It's silver on one side to reflect the light and heat, and black on the other side to block out the brightness of the sun, and the surrounding area. 
[^58]: Choose just one tracking configuration.
[^59]: Bad reviews. Cannot hande Canon 5D IV with EF 100-400mm.

[^65]: On this Canon page [Photographing the Total Eclipse / Canon U.S.A., Inc.](https://www.usa.canon.com/learning/training-articles/training-articles-list/photographing-an-eclipse ) is a very Stern warning: <br >**Don’t Use the Rear Filter Tray**<br />Most of the large Canon L-series super-telephoto lenses have a rear mounted slip-in filter tray. NEVER use a solar filter in this tray. This filter mounting system is designed for terrestrial photography using traditional photography filters. It is not designed to house a filter to be directed celestially into the sun. At these magnifications, you will destroy the filter — similar to taking a magnifying glass to a leaf and put your lens, sensor and your eyes in danger. The intense light and heat could fry aperture and image stabilization mechanisms, damage the autofocus sensor and, if the mirror is locked up ruin your sensor. Buy the correct front-mounted solar filter. They’re relatively inexpensive and completely safe.
