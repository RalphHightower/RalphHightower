[^11]: I compiled this list of links from [B&H Photo/Video](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/) [eXplora](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/ ), which contains articles, videos, podcasts, and product reviews. The list contains links to content related to astrophotography and night photography using associated keywords[^14]. If the content specifies a brand and offers no general advice, the link to the content is not in the list with the exceptions of the brands that I use. This is my website after all. Night photography encompasses many different topics, but this page focuses on astrophotography; so, fireworks and holiday lights are not in this list.
[^12]: These astrophotography articles are of particular interest to me.
[^13]: These topics are of interest to me, even though they are not astrophotography related. 
[^14]: Keywords, with article count in parentheses: [Astro Photography](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/astro-photography) (14), [Astronomy](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/astronomy) (86), [Astrophotography](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/astrophotography) (91), [Eclipse Photography](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/eclipse-photography) (19), [Milky Way Photography](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/milky-way-photography) (3), [Night Photography](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/night-photography) (70), [Solar Eclipse](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/solar-eclipse) (19), [Solar Filters](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/podcasts/tag/solar-filters) (1), [Solar Photography](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/tag/solar-photography) (6). Often, several keywords are used in tandem with a web page, so there is some overlap.
