## Aurora News

An aurora is a natural light display predominantly seen in the polar regions, caused by the interaction between the Earth’s magnetic field and charged particles from the Sun. These particles are carried towards the Earth by the solar wind and are mostly electrons and protons. When these charged particles collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, they excite the atoms, causing them to light up. The auroras occurring around the north pole are known as Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights, while those around the south pole are called Aurora Australis or Southern Lights. These displays can vary in color and complexity, from faint glows to rapidly shifting ribbons of light, depending on the type of gas particles involved and their altitude. This celestial phenomenon is not only a beautiful natural spectacle but also part of the larger space weather system that can affect satellite operations and power grids on Earth.

## Solar Dynamics Observatory News

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a NASA mission launched in February 2010 as part of the Living With a Star (LWS) program, which aims to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. The SDO is equipped with three advanced scientific instruments: the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), which together provide comprehensive measurements of the sun’s interior, atmosphere, magnetic field, and energy output. Operating in a geosynchronous orbit around Earth, the SDO supplies high-resolution images of the Sun in multiple wavelengths, offering unprecedented insights into solar activities such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and their effects on space weather. This continuous stream of data plays a crucial role in improving our understanding of the relationship between the Sun and the Earth’s environment.
