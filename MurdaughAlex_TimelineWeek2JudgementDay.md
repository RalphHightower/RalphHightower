|WALTERBORO — Paul Murdaugh had been calling and texting his friend on the evening of June 7, 2021, when suddenly the youngest of Alex Murdaugh’s sons stopped responding. Paul and his friend, Rogan Gibson, had been discussing Gibson’s puppy, who was staying at the dog kennels on the Murdaugh’s 1,770-acre hunting estate. Gibson sent a text at 8:49 p.m. asking Paul to photograph the dog’s injured tail so he could ask for a vet’s opinion. Though they had talked on the phone just five minutes earlier, Paul didn’t answer. Gibson tried to call him at 9:10 p.m., then again at 9:29, and 9:42, and 9:57. He texted him “*yo,”* and when he didn’t respond to that either, he called one more time at 10:08. He even texted Paul’s mother, Maggie Murdaugh, asking her to have Paul call him.|
|State prosecutors say Maggie and Paul’s phones had already locked for the final time — both at 8:49 p.m. Just minutes before that, they say, a video places the family patriarch, since-disgraced Hampton attorney Alex Murdaugh, with Maggie and Paul by the kennels. Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, wouldn’t leave the scene alive. Prosecutors on Jan. 30 showed a jury screenshots of Gibson’s communications with Paul as they continued their quest to prove that Alex Murdaugh brutally shot and killed his wife and son.|
|As Murdaugh’s double murder trial progressed into a second week, the S.C. Attorney General’s Office continued to present new witnesses and evidence. Over the past four days, prosecutors have unveiled a series of seemingly unrelated clues without explaining their significance, allowing jurors and a national viewing audience to wonder where the case is headed next. For example, at one point on Monday, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters elicited testimony that state investigators had rooted through a trash can near the crime scene and found a credit card statement on which someone had circled a $1,021.10 transaction made at Gucci.  But Waters never asked who spent that money, what it was for, who circled the expenditure, or what relevance it has to the case. Then he changed topics and never mentioned it again.|
|Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, however, have been far more direct. They spent the morning of Jan. 30 making the case that Colleton County sheriff’s deputies and State Law Enforcement Division agents contaminated the crime scene and mishandled evidence from the Murdaugh’s Colleton County estate, a hunting property the family called “Moselle.” In cross-examining SLED crime scene technician Melinda Worley, Harpootlian established investigators were unable to identify a number of footprints at the scene, in part because responders had walked all over the area. One bloody footprint in the feed room where Paul was killed turned out to belong to a member of law enforcement, Worley conceded. *“Is that preservation of the scene that your standards require?”* Harpootlian asked. *“Not exactly, no,”* Worley said. *“Not exactly,”* Harpootlian repeated. *“Should police be walking through the scene?”* *“No,”* Worley replied. With Worley on the stand, Harpootlian also floated a theory that Maggie and Paul were killed by two separate shooters. He asked what Worley made of the fact that the shotgun blasts that killed Paul appeared to be fired some distance away from the semiautomatic rifle shots that killed Maggie. *“Doesn’t this indicate to you there were two shooters?”* Harpootlian asked of the state’s ballistics analysis. *“Is it a possibility that there were two shooters?”* Worley suggested that the shooter could have moved after killing Paul and moving on to fire at Maggie. *“One explanation could be that there were two shooters,”* Harpootlian pressed. *“One explanation. Not ‘the’ explanation.”* *“Not the only one,”* Worley replied.|
|In calling their 10th witness, SLED agent Jeff Croft, prosecutors continued to lay the foundation for several key elements of their case.  Croft testified about searching the first-floor “gun room” at the Moselle estate’s main house and finding an arsenal of weaponry there. He and prosecutor Waters unboxed and presented a parade of 12-gauge shotguns and one .300 Blackout semiautomatic assault rifle — which belonged to Murdaugh’s other son, Buster - that SLED agents seized from the Moselle home. Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin objected to the gun show, arguing the guns were irrelevant since none of them were the murder weapons. But Judge Clifton Newman sided with Waters, who argued the presentation was necessary to show the exhaustiveness of the state’s investigation. Croft testified about searching the Moselle grounds and finding spent .300 Blackout shell casings by the gun room’s exterior door and on a shooting range across the street from the house.|
| Later in the trial, an expert witness for the state is expected to testify that those older shells had markings that matched shells found by Maggie’s body, proving she was killed with a Murdaugh family rifle. Prosecutors also lay the groundwork to show Murdaugh lied to investigators about his whereabouts on the night of the slayings. Waters played for the jury a recording of Murdaugh’s June 10, 2021, interview with SLED, his second. Three days after the slayings, Murdaugh allowed investigators to download the contents of his cellphone and answered a battery of politely posed questions, sometimes breaking down into tears and hysterics. Murdaugh told investigators he had gone into his Hampton law office on June 7, 2021, but came home early that day because Paul was coming by. He did not mention that his firm’s chief financial officer confronted him earlier that day about missing legal fees. Murdaugh and his son rode around the property for at least an hour and made plans to replant some sunflowers, Murdaugh said, *“doing things we like to do out there.”* Murdaugh told investigators Maggie joined them for dinner later that evening and then went down to the dog kennels. Murdaugh said he fell asleep while watching TV, but Paul must have joined his mother. He told SLED he never went down to the kennels or saw the two of them again before leaving Moselle shortly after 9 p.m. to visit his ailing mother. *“I stayed in the house,”* Murdaugh said.|
|That recording is a problem for Murdaugh, state prosecutors say, because investigators later unlocked Paul’s phone and found a video on it that places Murdaugh with his wife and son by the dog kennels shortly before they were killed. On that video, which jurors haven’t yet seen, Murdaugh is said to be heard talking with Maggie and Paul about a dog that had taken off with a chicken in its mouth. Murdaugh’s attorneys have described it as a “convivial” conversation, hardly the kind of talk you would expect to precede a pair of violent murders. But explaining to the jury why an innocent man would lie to SLED investigators about his whereabouts is one of the great challenges facing Murdaugh’s defense team in this trial. In his interview with investigators, Murdaugh insisted his relationship with his wife was *“very good.”* *“As good as it could possibly be,”* Murdaugh said. *“I mean, you know we’ve had our issues. But wonderful.”* Murdaugh said he and Maggie *“didn’t really argue,”* except in rare instances about how long the family would stay with her parents when they visited. Then, he began crying hysterically. *“She was a great mother,”* he wailed during testimony. In the interview, investigators brought up the *“traumatic picture”* Murdaugh saw when he came upon the crime scene. He began to whimper. *“It’s just so bad,”* he said. Murdaugh’s next words, utters through sobs, were difficult to make out. Some in the courtroom heard: *“They did him so bad.”* Others heard a possible confession: *“I did him so bad.”* Waters asked Croft what he heard. *“I did him so bad,”* Croft repeated. The courtroom camera panned to Murdaugh, who appeared to mouth to his attorneys: *“That’s not what I said.”* |

|Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys plant seeds of reasonable doubt …|
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters got the state off to a strong start last week, delivering a compelling opening argument and launching the state’s case with a bang with dramatic testimony from the first responders who arrived at the Murdaugh hunting property, known locally as Moselle. In pushing back against the prosecution, Murdaugh’s attorney Dick Harpootlian has consistently advanced a theme of shoddy police work – although prior to Monday, he had very little to work with on that front. On Monday, Harpootlian injected the theory of a “second shooter” into this graphic double homicide – while simultaneously building upon the narrative that law enforcement bungled the crime scene from the beginning.|
|Harpootlian reminded jurors that one of the responding officers left a bloody footprint in the feed room near the body of Paul Murdaugh. He also pointed to first responders traipsing through grassy areas where a shooter may have trailed Maggie Murdaugh. *“They were walking in an area where the perpetrator walked,”* Harpootlian said. *“Walking in the dark!”* Harpootlian also grilled Worley on the angles of .300 blackout shots fired from an AR-15 rifle through the wall of the feed room at the crime scene – including one angle measurement, which was incorrectly recorded into her official report. *“One of the shots fired by the AR was fired from somewhere way up here,”* Harpootlian said, pointing to a poster board based on Worley’s original crime scene sketch. *“The AR was some distance away from the feed room.”* *Does none of this indicate to you that there were two shooters?”* Harpootlian asked Worley. *“Is it conceivable?”* As Harpootlian tried to coax Worley into acknowledging a second shooter was a *“reasonable explanation,”* she pushed back, saying she couldn’t do so because she *“wasn’t there.”* *“None of us were there!”* Harpootlian responded. *“We’re trying to figure out what happened that night, and clearly, one of the explanations is two shooters!”*  Another exchange that saw Harpootlian appear to score points with jurors involved an impression found on the calf of Maggie Murdaugh, which he claimed contained was *“not a naturally occurring pattern.”* *“There was a footwear impression on Maggie’s calf,”* Harpootlian said. Harpootlian pressed Worley on whether or not she should have identified and examined the impression, adding *“once Maggie’s body had been removed, that examination could never be done.”* *“If I had realized … I would have documented it properly,”* Worley acknowledged. A photo of the impression was shown to jurors – but was not made available to media or to the courtroom audience. Jurors seemed to be closely following Harpootlian as he built his *“shoddy police work”* narrative to a climax. *“Do we know what other evidence they may have destroyed?”* Harpootlian asked Worley at one point. *“I have no idea,”* Worley replied. *“No, you don’t,”* Harpootlian responded.|
|Prosecutors reclaimed the momentum shortly before noon on Monday when SLED special agent Jeff Croft took the stand. Croft’s testimony allowed the state to introduce significant firearm and ballistics evidence given his starring role in collecting various guns and ammunition from multiple locations at Moselle. Lead prosecutor Waters walked Croft through the introduction of this evidence. Croft also provided some initial testimony, which touched cell phone evidence, likely to play such a huge role in this case. Specifically, Croft interviewed Rogan Gibson – a friend of Paul Murdaugh’s who was the last person to speak to him prior to his death. Croft testified that Gibson received two incoming phone calls from Murdaugh – one at 8:40 p.m. EDT and another at 8:44 p.m. EDT. The most damning one? The last time he saw Paul and Maggie alive was when the family ate dinner together in the main house at Moselle. *“Nobody was in that home when I left,”* Murdaugh told SLED special agent David Owen in the video. This is the so-called ironclad alibi that was shredded by a cell phone video taken by Paul Murdaugh just moments before he was murdered. That video has not been played for jurors.|
|Jurors also have yet to hear the August 2021 interview with SLED, in which Murdaugh is confronted about his presence a t the kennels. Initially taken aback at the assertion, Murdaugh informed investigators that they were wrong about this key point of information. *“No,”* he told them bluntly. Murdaugh later qualified this denial by saying there was no way he could have been at the kennels at the time the video was filmed *“unless my timeline is wrong.”*|

| WALTERBORO — Did Alex Murdaugh accidentally confess to brutally murdering his son, Paul, or did a state investigator misunderstand the prominent Hampton attorney’s words? That’s the question 12 Colleton County jurors will have to ponder in the coming days as they digest a piece of evidence that came into contention this week at Murdaugh’s double murder trial.|
|Jeff Croft, a special agent with the State Law Enforcement Division, swore he heard Murdaugh wail, *“I did him so bad,”* as he wept during a June 10, 2021, interview with state investigators. The conversation took place three days after Murdaugh reported finding his son and wife Maggie shot to death near a set of dog kennels at the family’s spacious hunting property. Columbia lawyer Jim Griffin, who was at the June 10 interview, contends his client said, *“They did him so bad.”* He played a recording of the interview three times for jurors to hear, slowing it down to one-third speed the last time. Several jurors leaned forward intently as the clip was replayed. Croft, for his part, stuck to his story on the stand. When Griffin asked if he was certain, Murdaugh said *“I,”* Croft testified he was *“100 percent confident”* that is what he heard. He agreed, however, that the jury would have to decide for itself what to believe.|
|The exchange helped kick off another busy day at the county courthouse, where prosecutors have presented 15 witnesses — mostly law enforcement or other first responders — in their effort to prove Murdaugh killed his wife and son. Prosecutors allege Murdaugh, 54, shot Paul with a shotgun and Maggie with a semiautomatic rifle in order to engender sympathy for himself and distract from a set of inquiries that were about to expose his myriad financial crimes. In addition to the murder charges, Murdaugh stands accused of nearly 100 other charges. Investigators say he leveraged his powerful family name and position as an attorney to surreptitiously steal nearly $9 million from legal settlements and fees owed to his law clients, coworkers and others who trusted him. A team of prosecutors in the murder trial have continued to unflip puzzle pieces in their case, often without explaining how the evidence and testimony fits together to prove Murdaugh guilty.|
|Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, meanwhile, have attempted to paint investigators as incompetent or untrustworthy, alleging they mishandled the crime scene and focused too narrowly on Murdaugh while excluding other possible suspects. They also have speculated that Maggie and Paul were killed by two shooters, given there was some distance between where the shots that killed them were fired.|
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters attempted to nip that in the bud on Jan. 31. *“Can people move?”* Waters asked agent Croft on the witness stand. *“People can move, yes sir,”* Croft replied. In his own questioning of Croft, Griffin sought to establish that SLED focused on Murdaugh from the beginning. Croft conceded that Murdaugh was on their radar from the start, noting that homicide detectives start with a small circle — whoever was at the crime scene — and work their way outward. Murdaugh was the only person alive at the crime scene when first responders arrived, Croft testified. But investigators then spoke with more than 100 people over the next few days, he said. Griffin spent considerable time questioning Croft about Murdaugh’s purported confession three days after the slayings. That would have been a significant admission, Griffin noted, yet neither of the SLED agents present had asked Murdaugh what he meant. Croft said SLED’s investigation was still in its infancy, and he *“did not have information”* to challenge Murdaugh’s statements. Griffin seemed puzzled by that explanation. Griffin asked if Croft had taken written notes of the interview. He had. The defense attorney then asked if he’d written anything about Murdaugh potentially confessing to the crime. Croft said only that he made a “mental note” to follow up on the statement later. But Griffin pointed out he never did, even when SLED interviewed Murdaugh a third time on Aug. 11, 2021 — two months later. *“You can’t tell the jury you even wrote it down on a piece of paper,”* Griffin said.|
| Later in the day, the state called a witness from Verizon to testify about call records and other information the telecommunications giant provided after receiving a subpoena. Prosecutors also called a U.S. Secret Service agent who testified he used software to break into Paul Murdaugh’s phone in March 2022 — nine months after the killings — in part by having the program try passcodes associated with the 22-year-old’s birthday.|
|In the afternoon, jurors heard from a Department of Natural Resources captain and part-time gunmaker who sold Murdaugh — his cousin — three .300 Blackout semi-automatic assault rifles. The first two — which together cost nearly $9,200 — were Christmas gifts in 2016 for Murdaugh’s sons, Paul and Buster, John Bedingfield testified. Murdaugh purchased the third weapon in April 2018 after Paul’s first one went missing. Investigators seized Buster’s rifle after the slayings. But both of Paul’s remain missing. Prosecutors say ballistics evidence shows 52-year-old Maggie was shot and killed with one of the missing rifles. The 12-gauge shotgun that killed Paul, 22, is also missing. With Croft on the stand, Griffin elicited testimony that investigators didn’t find the type of shotgun round used to deliver the fatal shot to Paul’s head — with waterfowl shell — anywhere on the hunting property, known as Moselle.|
|Prosecutors finished the day in the midst of questioning a SLED digital forensics expert about data he downloaded from the Murdaughs’ cellphones. Referencing phone records, Lt. Britt Dove testified about a string of calls and texts Maggie received on the evening of June 7, 2021, before and after her phone locked for the final time at 8:49 p.m. Those phone records are critical to the state’s effort to show when Maggie and Paul were killed — about the time their phones locked and stopped opening or sending messages. Prosecutors want to condense the timeline between their deaths and 8:44 p.m., when a video on Paul’s phone reportedly places Alex Murdaugh with the victims at the scene of the crime. Dove will remain on the witness stand when prosecutor John Conrad resumes his questioning Feb. 1.|

| Prosecutors and defense attorneys jockeyed for position – and narrative supremacy – as the second week of South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century’ hit its stride on Tuesday in Walterboro, S.C.  The main event of the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga – the double homicide trial of disbarred attorney/ accused killer Alex Murdaugh – saw chilling testimony Tuesday afternoon from lieutenant Britt Dove of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). A computer crimes specialist, Dove walked jurors through a timeline of the final moments of cell phone activity for Alex Murdaugh and his family members.|
|According to Dove’s analysis of phone data, Maggie Murdaugh placed an outgoing call to family housekeeper Barbara Mixon at 7:50 p.m. EST on June 7, 2021. That call was placed one hour before prosecutors say her husband gunned her down with five .300 blackout projectiles fired from an AR-15 rifle near the dog kennels on the hunting property, known locally as Moselle.|
|Maggie Murdaugh’s call to Mixon lasted nearly three minutes. It was the last outgoing, last speaking call recorded on her phone. In other words, it was the last call she ever made … and the last phone conversation she ever had.|
|Courtesy of FITSNews intrepid research director Jenn Wood, here is a timeline of the cell phone activity of Maggie Murdaugh on the evening of her murder …|
|• 8:17:15 p.m. Maggie’s phone was unplugged from a charging source.|
|• 8:30:23 p.m. Maggie was running Poshmark on her phone.|
|• 8:31:47 p.m. Group text message arrives from John Marvin Murdaugh inquiring about visiting his ailing father.|
|• 8:49:20 p.m. Maggie’s phone display was on – meaning her phone lit up. A notification could cause this.|
|• 8:49:26 p.m. An sms or text message was processing on Maggie’s phone.|
|• 8:49:26 p.m. Maggie’s phone locks.|
|• 8:49:26 p.m. Maggie’s phone unlocks.|
|• 8:49:27 p.m. Text received at 8:31:47 p.m. is read.|
|• 8:49:31 p.m. Maggie’s phone locked. The phone was not unlocked again until June 8, 2021 at 1:10:35 p.m.|
|• 8:53:08 p.m. Maggie’s phone display is off.|
|• 8:53:15 p.m. – 8:55:32 p.m. – Maggie’s phone recorded an estimated 59 steps (Dove previously testified that at this time someone appeared to be manipulating the phone).|
|• 8:53:44 p.m. Maggie’s display comes on and there is an orientation change from landscape to portrait.|
|• 8:54:40 p.m. Start time of orientation change to landscape.|
|• 8:54:44 p.m. End time of orientation change from landscape.|
|• 8:54:34 p.m. The camera starts on the phone. It is on and recording for one second. Dove states it appears the phone is being moved and the camera is being activated in the background to attempt to unlock it with biometric facial recognition. But after 8:49:31 p.m. the phone never unlocks again. There is no data that suggests what the camera was looking at during this time.|
|• 8:55:32 p.m. End time for portrait orientation change. Dove states it appears the phone is being held in someone’s hand at that time.|
|• 9:00:00 p.m. Activity sensor data on phone shows steps and distance traveled. A separate report shows more granular data on steps. The data would be a range between 9:00 to 10:00 p.m.|
|• 9:04:23 p.m. An unanswered phone call from Alex Murdaugh’s phone to Maggie’s phone is documented.|
|• 9:06:12 p.m. Start time of an orientation change from landscape to portrait.|
|• 9:06:14 p.m. Another unanswered phone call from Alex Murdaugh’s phone to Maggie’s phone is documented.|
|• 9:06:20 p.m. End time for all orientation changes cease on Maggie’s phone.|
|• 9:06:51 p.m. Another unanswered phone call from Alex Murdaugh’s phone to Maggie’s phone is documented.|
|• 9:07:00 p.m. Display on Maggie’s phone comes on and off.|
|• 9:08:58 p.m. Incoming text message from Alex to Maggie, *“Going to check on M. Be right back.”* This text was never read. Dove calculates the time to be 2 minutes and 7 seconds between call from Alex and text from Alex.|
|• 9:31:44 p.m. End time of display off. For 22 minutes nothing happens on Maggie’s phone. At this time, display comes on and off a number of times. Screen coming on and off doesn’t tell the investigators much.|
|• 9:34:14 p.m. – An unread text message comes from Rogan Gibson, *“Tell Paul to call me.”*|
|• 9:47:23 p.m. – Unread text message from Alex that reads, *“Call me babe.”*|
|Dove testifies that no one actively used that phone after that unread text message at 9:47:23 p.m. on June 7, 2021.
|Maggie Murdaugh’s phone was found on the roadside about a quarter mile from the crime scene the following afternoon. It was unlocked at that time by investigators with assistance from Alex Murdaugh’s brother, John Marvin Murdaugh.|
|*“Maggie Murdaugh testified from the grave,”* former S.C. attorney general Charlie Condon tweeted, crediting prosecutors for presenting “powerful cell phone evidence.” *“Maggie is saying this is what happened,”* Condon told WCIV TV-4 (ABC – Charleston, S.C.). *“(She is saying) what this defendant is saying is not true and listen to my testimony through this expert.”*|

Prosecutors say ballistics evidence shows 52-year-old Maggie was shot and killed with one of the missing rifles. The 12-gauge shotgun that killed Paul, 22, is also missing. |
|With Croft on the stand, Griffin elicited testimony that investigators didn’t find the type of shotgun round used to deliver the fatal shot to Paul’s head — with waterfowl shell — anywhere on the hunting property, known as Moselle.|
|Prosecutors finished the day in the midst of questioning a SLED digital forensics expert about data he downloaded from the Murdaughs’ cellphones. Referencing phone records, Lt. Britt Dove testified about a string of calls and texts Maggie received on the evening of June 7, 2021, before and after her phone locked for the final time at 8:49 p.m. Those phone records are critical to the state’s effort to show when Maggie and Paul were killed — about the time their phones locked and stopped opening or sending messages.|
|Prosecutors want to condense the timeline between their deaths and 8:44 p.m., when a video on Paul’s phone reportedly places Alex Murdaugh with the victims at the scene of the crime. Dove will remain on the witness stand when prosecutor John Conrad resumes his questioning Feb. 1.|

| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Trial: The Day The State Won?](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/01/murdaugh-murders-trial-the-day-the-state-won/)|
| Prosecutors hoping to put disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh in prison for life for the murder of his wife and son scored significant victories during a detailed and dramatic day of testimony in Walterboro, South Carolina on Wednesday. |
|The day began with prosecutors providing additional down-to-the-second detail on the cell phone activity of Alex, Maggie, and Paul Murdaugh on the night of the murders. This testimony was provided by lieutenant Britt Dove of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). One of the first prosecution witnesses to begin establishing a narrative of this shocking crime – which has attracted international attention – Dove’s testimony documented the calls, text messages and steps recorded by all three phones on the Moselle property. Critically, Dove testified that Alex Murdaugh’s phone recorded a gap in activity between approximately 8:09 p.m. and 9:02 p.m. on the evening of the murders – which prosecutors are implying indicated premeditation on his part. As for the time of the killings, Dove testified that Paul Murdaugh’s phone recorded him reading two text messages from a female friend at precisely 8:48:59 on the evening of June 7, 2021. He further testified Maggie Murdaugh’s phone and recorded her reading a text message at precisely 8:49:27. Just eight seconds later – at 8:49:35 – Paul Murdaugh received a text message from his childhood friend, Rogan Gibson. That message was never read. In fact, from that moment forward, neither Paul nor Maggie’s phone was ever unlocked again until the devices were in the possession of law enforcement officers investigating their murders.|
|While jurors were positively riveted by the details of this data, the most compelling testimony of the day came from Gibson.  In addition to confirming the cell phone activity detailed in Dove’s testimony, Gibson managed to humanize Paul Murdaugh – who had drawn the ire of many in the Lowcountry (and beyond) for his involvement in a February 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach of Hampton, S.C. Paul Murdaugh was facing three felony boating under the influence charges at the time of his murder.|
|According to Gibson, though, he was a fun-loving country boy. *“He loved the outdoors – huntin’ and fishin’ – he loved being out there at Moselle,”* Gibson said, referring to his friend. Rogan Gibson testified that the Murdaughs’ were his *“second family,”* and that Alex Murdaugh was like a *“second father”* to him. On the day of the murders, Gibson and Paul Murdaugh were texting each other about planting sunflowers. As this news outlet has previously reported, the two friends were also texting each other about Gibson’s chocolate lab – a dog named Cash whose tail was injured.|
|According to his testimony, Rogan received a call from Paul Murdaugh at around 8:40 p.m. on June 7, 2021 – less than ten minutes before Paul was murdered – to ask if there was something wrong with Cash’s tail. On this call, Rogan testified to hearing Maggie Murdaugh and a male voice he believed belonged to *“Mister Alex”* in the background. Gibson testified he was “99 percent” sure the voice he heard in the background on the call belonged to Alex Murdaugh. At 8:44 p.m. – five minutes before he was murdered – Paul tried to FaceTime Rogan so he could see the dog’s tail. Since cellular reception was often bad at Moselle, the friends discussed Paul sending Rogan a video of the dog instead.|
|*“Was that the last time you ever talked to your friend?”*|
| *“It was,”* Gibson said, becoming emotional. Gibson never received the video sent from Paul Murdaugh. In fact, he didn’t see it until November of 2022, when it was played for him by law enforcement.|
|After playing the video for Gibson, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked him to tell the jury what his level of confidence was that the voice on the recording belonged to Alex Murdaugh.|
|*“How sure are you now?”*|
|*“100 percent.”*|
|*‘Positive?”* Waters asked.|
|*“That’s correct,”* Gibson responded.|
|Another witness for the prosecution, Paul Murdaugh’s friend Will Loving, also testified he was *“100 percent”* sure the voice on the recording belonged to Alex Murdaugh.|
|During cross examination by Murdaugh attorney Jim Griffin, though, Gibson reiterated his love for the Murdaugh family and expressed his refusal to believe Alex Murdaugh was capable of killing his wife and son. *“Can you think of any reason why Alex Murdaugh would have murdered his wife and son?,”* Griffin asked Gibson. After an extended pause, Gibson said he could not.|
| During a follow-up examination from Waters, Gibson was asked whether he still felt as though he knew who Alex Murdaugh was. *“As you sit here today, did you really know him?”* Waters asked.|
|After a brief pause, Gibson responded that he did.|
|Wednesday’s testimony ended in dramatic fashion as Waters peppered the day’s final witness with a litany of alleged financial crimes perpetrated by Alex Murdaugh.|
|Murdaugh’s attorneys objected, invoking rule 404(b) of the South Carolina rules of criminal procedure.|
|According to that rule, evidence of *“other crimes, wrongs, or acts" is not admissible to prove the character of a person.”*  However, the rule does permit such *“prior bad acts”* to be admitted in order *“to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.”*|
|S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman is scheduled to address this issue outside the presence of the jury tomorrow morning …|

|WALTERBORO — To Rogan Gibson, the Murdaughs were like a second family. He grew up with brothers Paul and Buster, hunting, fishing, and driving ATVs on their family’s spacious Colleton County estate. He knew Paul as *“Rooster,”* and Buster as “Bus.” Their mother was *“Miss Maggie.”* |
|But on Feb. 1, state prosecutors employed that familiarity to have Gibson offer damaging testimony against *“Big Red,”* otherwise known as Alex Murdaugh.
The key moment of Gibson’s testimony centered on a video Paul Murdaugh recorded shortly before investigators believe he and his mother were shot dead in June 2021. The recording shows only Gibson’s dog, Cash, but it captured audio of the family talking. Gibson and Will Loving, another Murdaugh family friend, testified they were 100 percent certain they heard Alex Murdaugh’s voice on the recording. What’s more, Gibson said he remembered hearing Alex in the background when he and Paul spoke on the phone moments earlier.|
|The video is a critical piece of the criminal case that the S.C. Attorney General’s Office has brought against Alex Murdaugh, who stands trial at the Colleton County Courthouse. Prosecutors say it proves the 54-year-old former attorney was at the scene of the crime  five minutes before Maggie and Paul’s cell phones suddenly stopped sending texts, answering calls, and opening messages. It’s around this time that the state says the two were killed. In court Feb. 1, prosecutors played the video three times — offering the public a first glance at the footage.|
|They did so after spending several days establishing that Murdaugh repeatedly told investigators he hadn’t been down to the dog kennels, the location where Maggie and Paul were shot, until he found their bloody bodies there later that evening. |
|Gibson had long thought Murdaugh was with his wife and son that evening. Gibson was on the phone with Paul at 8:40 p.m. — 10 minutes before prosecutors say Murdaugh killed the 22-year-old with a shotgun and Maggie, 52, with a semiautomatic rifle. Gibson and Paul were discussing Gibson’s dog, who was staying at the kennels at Moselle, the family’s sprawling hunting estate. Paul was trying to take a photo of the chocolate lab puppy’s injured tail to send to Gibson. In an interview the day after the slayings, Gibson told investigators he could hear Maggie in the background. He said he was 99 percent confident he could hear Alex as well.|
|Gibson testified that he became sure in November 2022. That’s when investigators showed him the video Paul had recorded of the puppy. In the background of the video, which was taken at 8:44 p.m. the night of the killings, voices can be heard discussing a Murdaugh family dog, Bubba, who was running around with a chicken in his mouth.|
|*“Did you recognize the voices of your second family?”* lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked Gibson.|
|*“I did,”* he said.|
|Gibson testified Paul, and Maggie had both sounded normal over the phone a few minutes earlier. Neither seemed worried or nervous, as if they were in danger.|
|Defense attorney Jim Griffin asked Gibson if he could imagine any circumstance that would lead Murdaugh to brutally kill his wife and son.|
|*“Not that I can think of,”* Gibson responded.|
|Loving, another close Murdaugh family friend, offered similar testimony. *Waters played the kennel video and asked Loving how sure he was Alex could be heard in the background.|
|*“One-hundred percent,”* Loving replied.|
|Both Loving and Gibson spoke highly of the Murdaughs, saying the prominent Lowcountry family had been good to them. Neither saw issues between Alex and Maggie or Alex and Paul, testifying they seemed to be a close and affectionate family.|
|Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin, trying to stress that image, showed jurors a short video clip from the Murdaughs’ Edisto Beach house, where several friends stayed with the family for Memorial Day weekend. It showed Paul carrying a white sheet cake outside to Alex while the group sings *“Happy Birthday”* to him. Alex, holding a red plastic cup, tells the group, *“Thank y’all so much.”*|
|The two witnesses reacted differently as prosecutors played the kennel video. Gibson looked up part way through, gazing toward the ceiling. Loving smiled widely hearing Paul’s voice. Across the courtroom, Alex began to sob.|
|The state has presented 18 witnesses, including law enforcement, cellphone forensic experts, and Murdaugh family friends. Prosecutors have recently focused on introducing digital forensic evidence, such as cellphone data, to try to prove that Maggie and Paul were killed around 8:50 p.m. — the time their phone activity ends. That also was minutes after the video of Gibson’s dog at the kennels, which the witnesses said placed Alex at the scene.? Over the past two days, prosecutors have shown jurors a battery of step counts and down-to-the-second logs of phone calls and text messages that help track Alex, Paul and Maggie’s activity before and after tragedy struck.|
|Prosecutors established Feb. 1 that Alex’s call log the night of the murders was incomplete when they received it. Some of the entries — including five calls to Maggie that evening — had been deleted before investigators seized his phone in September 2021, testified Lt. Britt Dove, of the State Law Enforcement Division. (Murdaugh gave law enforcement access to his phone in June 2021 as well, but the results of their earlier analysis have not been made public.)|
|Murdaugh’s defense team, meanwhile, has employed much of the same evidence to bolster their theory that at least two shooters were involved in the slayings. In a win for Murdaugh on Feb. 1, defense attorney Phillip Barber elicited testimony from Dove that Alex and Maggie’s phones did not appear to move together on the night of the slayings, according to his analysis of their cellphone data. Using step counts from their iPhone’s Health app, Dove concluded that Murdaugh’s phone was moving at 9:06 p.m., though Maggie’s wasn’t. At the same moment, Murdaugh called Maggie. She didn’t pick up.|
|Murdaugh’s Chevrolet Suburban started about 30 minutes later, and he soon left the property, according to data from the SUV’s internal computer. At the same time, someone appears to have been handling Maggie’s phone, according to Dove’s analysis of its data. Barber wondered aloud if that’s when Maggie’s phone could have been tossed from a car window and onto the side of Moselle Road, where it was found the next day. Dove couldn’t say for certain when Maggie’s phone was discarded.|
|The prosecution has gone to great lengths through such testimony to place Murdaugh close to the crime scene at the time of the killings. But the state has yet to address why Murdaugh would have killed his wife and son. But late in the afternoon, Waters, the prosecutor, hinted that the state would soon begin to show jurors their theory of why Murdaugh would turn violent: that a pair of inquiries into his finances were closing in and he needed to buy himself time to avoid having a raft of alleged financial crimes exposed.|
|Murdaugh’s attorneys have fought to keep evidence of the financial crimes from being brought into the murder trial, and they have called the state’s theory outlandish. Judge Clifton Newman said he would rule on the issue on Feb. 2.|

|WALTERBORO — The chief financial officer of Alex Murdaugh’s former law firm testified at length Feb. 2 about how she discovered the prominent Hampton attorney had secretly stolen vast sums from his legal clients and law partners over the past decade. Under questioning from a state prosecutor, Jeanne Seckinger detailed the myriad schemes Murdaugh allegedly used to pilfer nearly $9 million from those who trusted him. A dummy bank account. Fake structured settlements. Fraudulent checks and money transfers. Seckinger’s testimony is an important piece of the state’s murder case against Murdaugh in the killings of his wife and son on June 7, 2021. It remains to be seen, however, whether a Colleton County jury will ever hear about it. Seckinger delivered her testimony with the jury excused from the room. So did two other witnesses who could speak to Murdaugh’s purported financial crimes: Michael Gunn, principal of an insurance company Murdaugh is accused of impersonating to steal from his clients; and Chris Wilson, a Bamberg attorney who testified he was tricked into helping Murdaugh plunder some $792,000 from his law firm.|
|Their testimony came during a special hearing — a sort of mock trial — borne out of a protracted dispute between prosecutors and defense attorneys. They have been legally jousting over whether jurors should be told about Murdaugh’s alleged decade-long spree of thefts and betrayal. The S.C. Attorney General’s Office is calling witnesses and presenting exhibits; Murdaugh’s lawyers are cross-examining them. But they are delivering their case to an audience of one — Judge Clifton Newman. If Newman sides with prosecutors, these witnesses will return to the stand to repeat their testimony before the jury. If Murdaugh’s team prevails, jurors might never hear from them.|
| **Hounds at the door** |
|Prosecutors hope to show that Murdaugh, 54, was aware his financial crimes were about to be exposed, in part because Seckinger had confronted him on the morning of June 7, 2021, about $792,000 in missing fees from a case he worked with Wilson, the Bamberg attorney. In an act of calculated desperation, prosecutors say Murdaugh fatally shot his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and son Paul, 22, that evening. He hoped to engender sympathy for himself and delay Seckinger’s questions, among inquiries, investigators allege. Months later, prosecutors said Murdaugh attempted a similar scheme. Over Labor Day weekend 2021, they claim he organized a bizarre incident in which he was shot in the head and said an unknown assailant had tried to kill him.|
| *“When the hounds are at the door … for Alex Murdaugh, violence happens,”* lead prosecutor Creighton Waters told the judge.|
|His tactic initially worked, Waters said. Seckinger backed off. A hearing scheduled for June 10, 2021 — in which Murdaugh might have been forced to turn over details of his finances — was postponed. But it all unraveled in September of that year when Seckinger and her coworkers at the Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth, Detrick law firm resumed their probe and uncovered a trail of thefts. All told, Murdaugh has been charged with nearly 100 crimes in the time since.|
|Murdaugh’s defense team argued Feb. 2 that the alleged financial crimes are irrelevant to the trial at hand — where their client faces two counts of murder. *“It’s all just a theory,” *defense attorney Jim Griffin told the judge. *“There’s no facts. Their theory is the best way out is for him to murder his wife and son”* and put himself in the middle of a homicide investigation? Griffin said prosecutors want testimony about the financial allegations admitted because they don’t have enough evidence to convict Murdaugh of murder. Instead, they need to smear Murdaugh as a bad guy, he has said. *“They’ve got a whole lot more evidence about financial misconduct than they do about murder,”* Griffin argued. *“That’s what this is all about.”* These arguments are not new. The two sides have made and repeated them in legal motions and pretrial hearings. Yet the judge has held off deciding how much — if any — of the financial evidence should be admitted. On Feb. 2, he sent the jury out of the room so he could hear a preview of that aspect of the state’s case.|
|Seckinger testified that in early September, she was on the verge of discovering a scheme in which Murdaugh allegedly sent millions in client money to a personal bank account. That day, Sept. 2, 2021, Murdaugh’s paralegal moved a folder on his desk, and a check from Wilson’s law office slipped out, representing part of the fees Seckinger had been searching for. It was proof, she said, that Murdaugh had been stealing from the firm his great-grandfather founded a century earlier.|
|Taking the stand for the first time, Chris Wilson said he was misled by Murdaugh, a friend since middle school, and his law school roommate. After a case they worked together, Wilson testified, Murdaugh told him he had received permission from PMPED to put his $792,000 share of the legal fees into annuities. So Wilson sent the money to Murdaugh directly in March 2021, instead of to his law firm as usual. But as the firm continued to question Murdaugh about the missing fees, Murdaugh reportedly told Wilson he wasn’t able to buy annuities after all. Wilson testified Murdaugh pledged to send the legal fees back so Wilson could send the entire $792,000 to PMPED. Murdaugh then sent Wilson $600,000, money he came up with by taking out loans, and told him the rest was on the way. Wilson said he agreed to spot Murdaugh $192,000 in the meantime.|
|On the stand, Wilson said he didn’t see any *“red flags”* at that point. But in August, after the slayings, he was concerned Murdaugh might try to hurt himself, and he decided he needed documentation of the loan. He wrote a short promissory note on a page of lined notebook paper. Murdaugh signed it. Less than three weeks later, PMPED told Wilson that Murdaugh had stolen from the firm and from its clients. Wilson insisted that Murdaugh explain what happened. They met on the porch of Murdaugh’s parents’ home, where Murdaugh told Wilson he had been addicted to painkillers for more than 20 years and admitted to stealing money. *“He said he had (expletive) a lot of people up,”* Wilson said. The two did not speak again, Wilson said.|
|Murdaugh’s trial will remain bifurcated for at least another day. The financial hearing will resume at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 3, though the jury will not be present. )The judge indicated wants to hear from at least one more financial crime witness before issuing a ruling. That witness, however, isn’t available to testify until Feb. 6.|
|Though the fight over financial evidence dominated the day, the jury was able to hear witnesses testify specifically about the investigation into the June 2021 slayings.|
|Dylan Hightower, an investigator with the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office, testified about call logs he pulled separately from Murdaugh’s phone and from the telecommunications company Verizon. When comparing the two records, Hightower testified, all but two of Murdaugh’s 75 calls from the date of the slayings had been deleted from his phone. Hightower said he couldn’t say who deleted them or why. Investigators downloaded the contents of Murdaugh’s phone three days after the slayings.|
|The state’s 21st and latest witness, State Law Enforcement Division agent Katie McAllister, testified she searched every room of the main home on the Murdaugh’s 1,770-acre hunting  property, known as Moselle, on the day after the slayings. Under cross-examination from defense attorney Dick Harpootlian, she acknowledged she found no blood or bloody clothes in the house that would have indicated the killer cleaned themselves up there afterward.|
| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: Trial Could Last Into March](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/02/murdaugh-murders-saga-trial-could-last-into-march/)|
|Judge now budgeting six weeks for proceedings …|
| The double homicide trial of disbarred South Carolina attorney and accused killer Alex Murdaugh could run into the middle of March, multiple sources familiar with the timing of the proceedings have confirmed.  A revised trial schedule has reportedly been approved by S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman – who originally budgeted three weeks for these proceedings (January 23 – February 17, 2023).|
|The latest schedule would extend the trial by another three weeks – with a projected end date of March 10, 2023. Jury selection and pre-trial motions in this case were handled faster than expected, with opening arguments coming on the third day of the trial (some had projected the jury selection process to take up to a week).|
|The following day – last Thursday – lead prosecutor Creighton Waters and his team of attorneys began presenting the state’s evidence against Murdaugh. They are currently in their sixth full day of presenting evidence – although the proceedings have been interrupted by a debate over the admissibility of evidence related to financial crimes Murdaugh has either confessed judgment to or been accused of committing.|
|This debate has devolved into something of a *“trial within a trial”* – one taking place outside the presence of the jury over whether or not jurors will be able to hear certain testimony from witnesses for the prosecution. Ironically? The debate over the admissibility of this evidence was one of the issues essentially skipped during the pretrial motions phase of the proceedings.
| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: ‘A Trial Within A Trial’](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/02/02/murdaugh-murders-saga-a-trial-within-a-trial/)|
|Parallel proceedings underway as double homicide trial moves into critical phase …|
|Disbarred South Carolina attorney and accused killer Alex Murdaugh‘s double homicide trial spawned a *“trial within a trial”* on Thursday as his attorneys and prosecutors in the office of attorney general Alan Wilson battled over the admissibility of key evidence and testimony.|
|The story – which has attracted international attention – has shone a light not only on a graphic crime, but also the maze of criminality revolving around this scion of the *“House of Murdaugh,”* a powerful legal dynasty which ran the Palmetto State’s Lowcountry like its own fiefdom for more than a century. |
|That maze came to the fore on Thursday as prosecutors sought to include evidence and testimony related to the nearly 100 financial crimes of which Murdaugh currently stands accused.
Normally, such evidence and testimony would be excluded under South Carolina law. In this case, however, prosecutors contend there is a direct nexus to this information and their theory of motive in this graphic double homicide. Prosecutors are also eager to introduce evidence and testimony tied to the 2019 boat crash case, which began the unraveling of the Murdaugh empire.|
|Debate over the admissibility of these key areas of evidence and testimony essentially took over the trial on Thursday, leading to a lengthy in camera review involving multiple witnesses who took the stand in front of an empty jury box. In camera is Latin for *“in a chamber.”* It refers to a portion of a trial which takes place outside the presence of the jury – and sometimes outside the presence of the media – to determine which witnesses and lines of inquiry will be allowed.|
|Presiding S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman initiated this review after previously allowing lead prosecutor Creighton Waters to aggressively raise these lines of inquiry in front of the jury during his questioning of witness Will Loving late Wednesday. According to Newman, defense attorneys opened the door for Waters when they asked Loving whether he could think of *“any reason possible why Mr. Murdaugh would commit the crimes he is accused of committing.”* *“That, in effect, turned the cross examination of that witness from dealing with the specific issues in the case to having that witness testify as a character witness for Mr. Murdaugh,”* Newman said. “In the court’s view that opened the door for the state to respond by asking the questions as the state did.”|
|Newman also chided defense attorney Dick Harpootlian’s objection to Waters’ line of questioning as *“totally inappropriate.”* *“Objections should be made and the legal basis stated,”* Newman said. *“An objection of ‘totally inappropriate’ is … in effect, no objection at all. That’s not a legal basis for an objection.”*|
|Given the defense’s invocation of Murdaugh’s character as a *“common thread”* of its questioning of multiple witnesses, Newman ruled against Murdaugh on his attorneys’ objection under Rule 403 of the South Carolina rules of criminal procedure. Rule 403 holds that relevant evidence *“may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”* According to the judge, Murdaugh’s attorneys *“opened the door”* to the introduction of such relevant evidence and testimony by advancing their own lines of questioning in this case.|
|Murdaugh’s attorneys also objected to the introduction of evidence and testimony under rule 404(b) of the South Carolina rules of criminal procedure. According to that rule, evidence of *“other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person.”* However, the rule does permit such *“prior bad acts”* to be admitted in order *“to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.”*|
|The debate over those objections – which, again, took place outside the presence of the jury – consumed the majority of Thursday’s deliberations. That debate is also expected to consume (at least) the first two hours of deliberations on Friday, as prosecutors continue to put forward witnesses for the court’s review regarding admissibility challenges beginning at 9:30 a.m. EST.|
|What evidence will Newman allow? What evidence will he exclude? It is not clear when he intends to issue a ruling, but if Thursday’s hearing – a preview of potential testimony the jury could hear in the days to come – is any indication of where this trial is going, the defense is in serious trouble.|
|Among the most damning tidbits?|
|According to Jeanne Seckinger, the chief financial officer of the law firm where Murdaugh worked, Murdaugh glared at her on the day of the murders after she pressed him to provide details regarding attorneys’ fees in a case he worked with his childhood friend, attorney Chris Wilson of Bamberg, S.C. *“He gave me a mean look,”* Seckinger said, describing the glare she received from Murdaugh on the morning of June 7, 2021 as an expression she *“hadn’t seen from him before.”*  Seckinger previously testified about confronting Murdaugh in the federal trial of convicted fraudster Russell Laffitte.[^1]|
|Chris Wilson also testified outside the presence of the jury, describing how Murdaugh – whom he described as his best friend – allegedly stole nearly $200,000 from him as part of one of his financial fleecings. According to Wilson, Murdaugh belatedly admitted that he had stolen money from him and others – claiming *“he was addicted to opioids and that he had been addicted for twenty years or so.”* Murdaugh made this admission to Wilson during a face-to-face meeting on September 4, 2021 – just hours before he was involved in a bizarre roadside shooting incident on Old Salkehatchie Road near Varnville, S.C. |
|During this meeting, Wilson said Murdaugh confessed to stealing from him – and others. At this point, Waters asked the witness whether Murdaugh *“had a particular phrase he used.”*|
| *“Shit me up,”* Wilson responded.|
| *“He said he ‘shit you up?'”* Waters asked.|
| *“Shit me up, shit me up or shit me off – I think it was shit me up,”* Wilson said. *“He said that he had shit a lot of people up.”*|
|As Waters continued to question him, Wilson broke down into tears describing the aftermath of that confrontation. *“I was so mad,”* Wilson said, recalling the moment Murdaugh allegedly acknowledged his habitual deceit. *“I had loved the guy for so long – and I probably still love him a little bit – but I was so mad.”* |
|If jurors hear substantive testimony like that from either of these two witnesses, Murdaugh could be finished.|
|In the meantime, though, the extensive in camera debate over admissibility of evidence and testimony stalled significant momentum for the prosecution as it continued building its narrative against Murdaugh on the double homicides. That momentum is expected to pick up – with a vengeance – once the ‘trial within the trial’ concludes.|
|Prosecutors had a huge day on Wednesday as they introduced critical cell phone evidence, which provided jurors with down-to-the-second detail on the cell phone activity of Alex, Maggie, and Paul Murdaugh on the night of the murders. Jurors also heard riveting testimony from Paul Murdaugh’s childhood friend, Rogan Gibson|
|Most significantly on Wednesday, they saw for the first time the cell phone video taken by Paul Murdaugh just five minutes before his death – a video that shredded Alex Murdaugh’s alibi.|
