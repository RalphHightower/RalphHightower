|WALTERBORO — Paul Murdaugh had been calling and texting his friend on the evening of June 7, 2021, when suddenly the youngest of Alex Murdaugh’s sons stopped responding. Paul and his friend, Rogan Gibson, had been discussing Gibson’s puppy, who was staying at the dog kennels on the Murdaugh’s 1,770-acre hunting estate. Gibson sent a text at 8:49 p.m. asking Paul to photograph the dog’s injured tail so he could ask for a vet’s opinion. Though they had talked on the phone just five minutes earlier, Paul didn’t answer. Gibson tried to call him at 9:10 p.m., then again at 9:29, and 9:42, and 9:57. He texted him “*yo,”* and when he didn’t respond to that either, he called one more time at 10:08. He even texted Paul’s mother, Maggie Murdaugh, asking her to have Paul call him.|
|State prosecutors say Maggie and Paul’s phones had already locked for the final time — both at 8:49 p.m. Just minutes before that, they say, a video places the family patriarch, since-disgraced Hampton attorney Alex Murdaugh, with Maggie and Paul by the kennels. Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, wouldn’t leave the scene alive. Prosecutors on Jan. 30 showed a jury screenshots of Gibson’s communications with Paul as they continued their quest to prove that Alex Murdaugh brutally shot and killed his wife and son.|
|As Murdaugh’s double murder trial progressed into a second week, the S.C. Attorney General’s Office continued to present new witnesses and evidence. Over the past four days, prosecutors have unveiled a series of seemingly unrelated clues without explaining their significance, allowing jurors and a national viewing audience to wonder where the case is headed next. For example, at one point on Monday, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters elicited testimony that state investigators had rooted through a trash can near the crime scene and found a credit card statement on which someone had circled a $1,021.10 transaction made at Gucci.  But Waters never asked who spent that money, what it was for, who circled the expenditure, or what relevance it has to the case. Then he changed topics and never mentioned it again.|
|Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, however, have been far more direct. They spent the morning of Jan. 30 making the case that Colleton County sheriff’s deputies and State Law Enforcement Division agents contaminated the crime scene and mishandled evidence from the Murdaugh’s Colleton County estate, a hunting property the family called “Moselle.” In cross-examining SLED crime scene technician Melinda Worley, Harpootlian established investigators were unable to identify a number of footprints at the scene, in part because responders had walked all over the area. One bloody footprint in the feed room where Paul was killed turned out to belong to a member of law enforcement, Worley conceded. *“Is that preservation of the scene that your standards require?”* Harpootlian asked. *“Not exactly, no,”* Worley said. *“Not exactly,”* Harpootlian repeated. *“Should police be walking through the scene?”* *“No,”* Worley replied. With Worley on the stand, Harpootlian also floated a theory that Maggie and Paul were killed by two separate shooters. He asked what Worley made of the fact that the shotgun blasts that killed Paul appeared to be fired some distance away from the semiautomatic rifle shots that killed Maggie. *“Doesn’t this indicate to you there were two shooters?”* Harpootlian asked of the state’s ballistics analysis. *“Is it a possibility that there were two shooters?”* Worley suggested that the shooter could have moved after killing Paul and moving on to fire at Maggie. *“One explanation could be that there were two shooters,”* Harpootlian pressed. *“One explanation. Not ‘the’ explanation.”* *“Not the only one,”* Worley replied.|
|In calling their 10th witness, SLED agent Jeff Croft, prosecutors continued to lay the foundation for several key elements of their case.  Croft testified about searching the first-floor “gun room” at the Moselle estate’s main house and finding an arsenal of weaponry there. He and prosecutor Waters unboxed and presented a parade of 12-gauge shotguns and one .300 Blackout semiautomatic assault rifle — which belonged to Murdaugh’s other son, Buster - that SLED agents seized from the Moselle home. Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin objected to the gun show, arguing the guns were irrelevant since none of them were the murder weapons. But Judge Clifton Newman sided with Waters, who argued the presentation was necessary to show the exhaustiveness of the state’s investigation. Croft testified about searching the Moselle grounds and finding spent .300 Blackout shell casings by the gun room’s exterior door and on a shooting range across the street from the house.|
| Later in the trial, an expert witness for the state is expected to testify that those older shells had markings that matched shells found by Maggie’s body, proving she was killed with a Murdaugh family rifle. Prosecutors also lay the groundwork to show Murdaugh lied to investigators about his whereabouts on the night of the slayings. Waters played for the jury a recording of Murdaugh’s June 10, 2021, interview with SLED, his second. Three days after the slayings, Murdaugh allowed investigators to download the contents of his cellphone and answered a battery of politely posed questions, sometimes breaking down into tears and hysterics. Murdaugh told investigators he had gone into his Hampton law office on June 7, 2021, but came home early that day because Paul was coming by. He did not mention that his firm’s chief financial officer confronted him earlier that day about missing legal fees. Murdaugh and his son rode around the property for at least an hour and made plans to replant some sunflowers, Murdaugh said, *“doing things we like to do out there.”* Murdaugh told investigators Maggie joined them for dinner later that evening and then went down to the dog kennels. Murdaugh said he fell asleep while watching TV, but Paul must have joined his mother. He told SLED he never went down to the kennels or saw the two of them again before leaving Moselle shortly after 9 p.m. to visit his ailing mother. *“I stayed in the house,”* Murdaugh said.|
|That recording is a problem for Murdaugh, state prosecutors say, because investigators later unlocked Paul’s phone and found a video on it that places Murdaugh with his wife and son by the dog kennels shortly before they were killed. On that video, which jurors haven’t yet seen, Murdaugh is said to be heard talking with Maggie and Paul about a dog that had taken off with a chicken in its mouth. Murdaugh’s attorneys have described it as a “convivial” conversation, hardly the kind of talk you would expect to precede a pair of violent murders. But explaining to the jury why an innocent man would lie to SLED investigators about his whereabouts is one of the great challenges facing Murdaugh’s defense team in this trial. In his interview with investigators, Murdaugh insisted his relationship with his wife was *“very good.”* *“As good as it could possibly be,”* Murdaugh said. *“I mean, you know we’ve had our issues. But wonderful.”* Murdaugh said he and Maggie *“didn’t really argue,”* except in rare instances about how long the family would stay with her parents when they visited. Then, he began crying hysterically. *“She was a great mother,”* he wailed during testimony. In the interview, investigators brought up the *“traumatic picture”* Murdaugh saw when he came upon the crime scene. He began to whimper. *“It’s just so bad,”* he said. Murdaugh’s next words, utters through sobs, were difficult to make out. Some in the courtroom heard: *“They did him so bad.”* Others heard a possible confession: *“I did him so bad.”* Waters asked Croft what he heard. *“I did him so bad,”* Croft repeated. The courtroom camera panned to Murdaugh, who appeared to mouth to his attorneys: *“That’s not what I said.”* |

|Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys plant seeds of reasonable doubt …|
|Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters got the state off to a strong start last week, delivering a compelling opening argument and launching the state’s case with a bang with dramatic testimony from the first responders who arrived at the Murdaugh hunting property, known locally as Moselle. In pushing back against the prosecution, Murdaugh’s attorney Dick Harpootlian has consistently advanced a theme of shoddy police work – although prior to Monday, he had very little to work with on that front. On Monday, Harpootlian injected the theory of a “second shooter” into this graphic double homicide – while simultaneously building upon the narrative that law enforcement bungled the crime scene from the beginning.|
|Harpootlian reminded jurors that one of the responding officers left a bloody footprint in the feed room near the body of Paul Murdaugh. He also pointed to first responders traipsing through grassy areas where a shooter may have trailed Maggie Murdaugh. *“They were walking in an area where the perpetrator walked,”* Harpootlian said. *“Walking in the dark!”* Harpootlian also grilled Worley on the angles of .300 blackout shots fired from an AR-15 rifle through the wall of the feed room at the crime scene – including one angle measurement, which was incorrectly recorded into her official report. *“One of the shots fired by the AR was fired from somewhere way up here,”* Harpootlian said, pointing to a poster board based on Worley’s original crime scene sketch. *“The AR was some distance away from the feed room.”* *Does none of this indicate to you that there were two shooters?”* Harpootlian asked Worley. *“Is it conceivable?”* As Harpootlian tried to coax Worley into acknowledging a second shooter was a *“reasonable explanation,”* she pushed back, saying she couldn’t do so because she *“wasn’t there.”* *“None of us were there!”* Harpootlian responded. *“We’re trying to figure out what happened that night, and clearly, one of the explanations is two shooters!”*  Another exchange that saw Harpootlian appear to score points with jurors involved an impression found on the calf of Maggie Murdaugh, which he claimed contained was *“not a naturally occurring pattern.”* *“There was a footwear impression on Maggie’s calf,”* Harpootlian said. Harpootlian pressed Worley on whether or not she should have identified and examined the impression, adding *“once Maggie’s body had been removed, that examination could never be done.”* *“If I had realized … I would have documented it properly,”* Worley acknowledged. A photo of the impression was shown to jurors – but was not made available to media or to the courtroom audience. Jurors seemed to be closely following Harpootlian as he built his *“shoddy police work”* narrative to a climax. *“Do we know what other evidence they may have destroyed?”* Harpootlian asked Worley at one point. *“I have no idea,”* Worley replied. *“No, you don’t,”* Harpootlian responded.|
|Prosecutors reclaimed the momentum shortly before noon on Monday when SLED special agent Jeff Croft took the stand. Croft’s testimony allowed the state to introduce significant firearm and ballistics evidence given his starring role in collecting various guns and ammunition from multiple locations at Moselle. Lead prosecutor Waters walked Croft through the introduction of this evidence. Croft also provided some initial testimony, which touched cell phone evidence, likely to play such a huge role in this case. Specifically, Croft interviewed Rogan Gibson – a friend of Paul Murdaugh’s who was the last person to speak to him prior to his death. Croft testified that Gibson received two incoming phone calls from Murdaugh – one at 8:40 p.m. EDT and another at 8:44 p.m. EDT. The most damning one? The last time he saw Paul and Maggie alive was when the family ate dinner together in the main house at Moselle. *“Nobody was in that home when I left,”* Murdaugh told SLED special agent David Owen in the video. This is the so-called ironclad alibi that was shredded by a cell phone video taken by Paul Murdaugh just moments before he was murdered. That video has not been played for jurors.|
|Jurors also have yet to hear the August 2021 interview with SLED, in which Murdaugh is confronted about his presence a t the kennels. Initially taken aback at the assertion, Murdaugh informed investigators that they were wrong about this key point of information. *“No,”* he told them bluntly. Murdaugh later qualified this denial by saying there was no way he could have been at the kennels at the time the video was filmed *“unless my timeline is wrong.”*|
