## 🍞 Storm Bread Substitute: The Shelf‑Stable Carb Module

When bread disappears and the oven goes dark, the real heroes are the non‑perishable, no‑power carbs. These are the items that quietly sit on the shelf while everyone else is panic‑buying French toast ingredients.

1. Tortillas
- Long shelf life  
- No baking required  
- Work for sandwiches, wraps, breakfast, anything  
- Don’t get stale as fast as bread  

2. Crackers
- Zero prep  
- Pair with peanut butter, cheese, tuna, anything  
- High morale‑per‑ounce ratio  

3. Pita or Flatbread
- Often overlooked  
- Lasts longer than loaf bread  
- Works cold, warm, or toasted (if power returns)  

4. Shelf‑stable rolls (King’s Hawaiian, etc.)
- Surprisingly durable  
- No refrigeration needed  
- Good for quick meals during outages  

5. Peanut butter + anything above
- The ultimate outage sandwich system
