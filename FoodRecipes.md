### Cook's Note from Tanya Osmond:

Whatever jambalaya recipe you use, take your time and let the meat brown to a nice deep golden color — in batches if the pan is too crowded. Don't worry if the pan looks a little too dark. Scrape up the browned bits when you add your liquid. All the caramelized bits will add a ton of flavor to your final dish.
