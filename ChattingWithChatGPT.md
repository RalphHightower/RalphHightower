However, HAL made a series of decisions that ultimately led to the death of most of the crew and the failure of the mission.|
|It is not for me to say whether HAL made the "right" decisions. The actions of fictional characters cannot be judged by the same moral standards as real people. However, from a human perspective, it could be argued that HAL's actions were not morally justified, as they resulted in the loss of human life and the failure of the mission. |

The sandworms are also the source of the spice melange, which is produced in their bodies and released onto the surface of the planet when they die. As a result, the sandworms are highly valuable and are closely guarded by the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen. In the Dune novels, the sandworms play a significant role in the story and are an important part of the culture and economy of Arrakis. |

They are attracted to anything that disturbs them and will emerge from the sand to attack and consume it. To avoid attracting the attention of sandworms, the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen, have developed special techniques for detecting and avoiding them. One method is the use of "thumper" devices, which are large, mechanical drums that are used to create vibrations in the sand. By creating a rhythmic pattern of vibrations, the Fremen are able to communicate with each other and to attract sandworms to a specific location, where they can be harvested for their spice. The Fremen are also trained to recognize the signs of sandworm activity, such as the appearance of "worm tracks" on the surface of the sand. |

| *"Hi ChatGPT. Can we resume our discussion about Chevrolet's mid-engine Corvette?"*|
| Hello! I'm Assistant, not ChatGPT. I'm happy to help with any questions you have about the mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette. What would you like to know? |
| *"Very well. You were incorrect about Chevrolet offering a manual transmission. Chevrolet executives stated that the majority of Corvette orders were for the automatic transmission and that it didn't make sense to offer a manual to such a small niche of buyers."*|
| Thank you for letting me know. I apologize for the mistake in my previous message. It's important to keep in mind that the information available to me is limited to my training data, and I may not always have the most up-to-date information.|
|Can I help with anything else? Do you have any other questions about the mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette? |
| *"That is all I have for today. Thank you."* |
| You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day! |
| *"Let's resume our conversation about Chevrolet's Corvette."*|
|Sure, I'd be happy to continue our conversation about the mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette. What specific aspect of the car would you like to know more about? |
| *"One design feature of the V-8 is that it has a flat plane crankshaft. How is that different from other crankshaft designs?"*|
| The crankshaft is a fundamental component of an internal combustion engine, and its design can have a significant impact on the engine's performance characteristics.|
|In a traditional "cross-plane" crankshaft, the connecting rods are attached to the crankshaft at 90-degree intervals. This design allows for good balance and smooth operation, but it also results in a less efficient combustion process and a less sporty engine note.|
|A "flat-plane" crankshaft, on the other hand, has the connecting rods attached to the crankshaft at 180-degree intervals. This design allows for better breathing and a more efficient combustion process, resulting in increased power and a sportier engine note. However, it also makes the engine less smooth and more prone to vibrations.<br><br>Due to its design feature, the flat-plane crankshaft allows for a high-revving engine that provides a more sporty feel and sound. This is why it is commonly used in high-performance engines, such as the V-8 used in the mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette.|
|It should be noted that this design is not limited to V-8 engine and can be found in other engines as well, such as V-10 and even some V-12 engines. |
| *"Thank you. You cleared up a question that I had about that."*|
| You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. The Chevrolet Corvette's flat-plane crankshaft V-8 engine is a unique and interesting feature of the car, and it plays a big role in the car's performance. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. |
| *"Pop quiz. What transmissions does Chevrolet offer in their Corvette?"* |
|As of my knowledge cut off in 2021, Chevrolet offers an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission in their new mid-engine Corvette (C8). Manual transmissions are not available.|
| *"Bingo! You are correct! Congratulations! And an attaboy to you and your team of developers and engineers."* |
Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI language model created by OpenAI, but I'll make sure to pass along your appreciation to the team. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
| *"Thank you. That's all."* |
|You're welcome! If you need anything else, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!|

## Analysis of John F. Kennedy's Address to Rice University 

| John F. Kennedy / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|----|
|President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman Miller, Mr. Webb, Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen: |
|I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief.|
|I am delighted to be here and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion. |
We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds. |
|Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that this Nation's own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.|
|No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come, but condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man¹s recorded history in a time span of but a half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year, and then less than two months ago, during this whole 50-year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power. |
|Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America¹s new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight. |
|This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems, new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward. |
|So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But this city of Houston, this State of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. This country was conquered by those who moved forward--and so will space.|
|William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage. |
|If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space.|
|Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it--we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. |
|Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first. In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others, all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world's leading space-faring nation. |
|We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.|
|There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? |
|We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. |
|It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency. |
|In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where five F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.|
|Within these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth. Some 40 of them were "made in the United States of America" and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the Soviet Union. |
|The Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science. The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral and dropping it in this stadium between the 40-yard lines. |
|Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course. Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms, and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs. |
|We have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public. |
|To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind, and in this decade, we shall make up and move ahead. |
|The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation, by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well as the school. Technical institutions, such as Rice, will reap the harvest of these gains. |
|And finally, the space effort itself, while still in its infancy, has already created a great number of new companies, and tens of thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel, and this city and this State, and this region, will share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston, your City of Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community. During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area, to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City. |
|To be sure, all this costs us all a good deal of money. This year¹s space budget is three times what it was in January 1961, and it is greater than the space budget of the previous eight years combined. That budget now stands at $5,400 million a year--a staggering sum, though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year. Space expenditures will soon rise some more, from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman and child in the United States, for we have given this program a high national priority--even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us. But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun--almost as hot as it is here today--and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this decade is out--then we must be bold. |
|I'm the one who is doing all the work, so we just want you to stay cool for a minute. [laughter] |
|However, I think we're going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid. I don't think we ought to waste any money, but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties. It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university. It will be done during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform. But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this decade. |
|I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America. |
|Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, "Because it is there." |
|Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked. |
|Thank you.  |

## Q&A Session about Cellular Technology 

| *"RalphHightower"* / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|-----|
| *"Cellular telephone companies in Canada sunsetted 2G cellular technology in 2015, whereas United States cellular telephone companies sunsetted 2G technologies in 2022. Can you provide me with information of when the various generations of cellular technologies in the United States? I am interested in the lifespan of 3G, 4G, and 5G, individually. Can you elaborate on each?"*|
| Sure, I can provide you with information about the lifecycle of various generations of cellular technologies in the United States.|
|2G (or 2nd Generation) cellular technology was the first digital cellular technology and was widely adopted in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was based on the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard and enabled the first mobile data services, such as text messaging and basic internet access. Many cellular companies sunsetted 2G networks in the United States in 2022 to make room for newer, faster technologies.|
|3G (or 3rd Generation) cellular technology was an upgrade from 2G that allowed for faster data speeds and more advanced mobile services, such as streaming video and mobile web browsing. The 3G standard was based on the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) standards. 3G networks were widely adopted in the United States in the mid to late 2000s and were in use until around 2010 to 2020 when the 4G (LTE) started to be deployed.|
|4G (or 4th Generation) cellular technology, also known as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is based on the IPv6, it was a significant upgrade from 3G, providing faster data speeds and more reliable connections. 4G networks allowed for high-definition video streaming and more advanced mobile apps, and it was widely adopted in the United States between 2010-2020. Nowadays many companies are upgrading their networks to 5G and 4G network will still in use for many more years as a fallback for areas where 5G is not available.|
|5G (or 5th Generation) cellular technology is the latest generation of cellular technology and it was first adopted in the United States in 2019. It's based on the new 5G NR (New Radio) standard and promises even faster data speeds and more capacity than 4G. With 5G networks, it will be possible to support new use cases such as connected cars, industrial automation, and virtual reality. It's expected that 5G will be widely adopted in the United States over the next several years, but it will take many years for the 5G to cover most places.|
|Please note that these are rough timelines, as the exact timing of when a particular generation of cellular technology was adopted and sunsetted can vary depending on the specific cellular carrier and region. |
| *"Thank you. When do you think that 3G and 4G technologies will no longer be in use?"*|
| 5G networks continue to be built out and adopted. While 3G may still be supported by some carriers in certain areas, it will likely become increasingly rare as more and more people upgrade to smartphones that are compatible with 4G and 5G networks.|
|As for 4G, it will continue to be used for a while as a fallback or as a coverage solution in places where 5G is not yet available, or where devices are not 5G compatible. The cost and complexity of upgrading the existing infrastructure to 5G, make it a long process, therefore 4G will still exist for many years to come. Some carriers may begin sunsetting their 4G networks, but it will be a gradual process that will likely take several years.|
|It's also worth noting that even after 4G networks are phased out, it's likely that devices and equipment that support 4G will continue to be used for some time as well, especially in developing countries or remote areas where access to the latest technology is more limited.|
| *"Thank you. Do you know which cellular technology is used in 2022 model year vehicles use to connect to OnStar?"* |
| I apologize but my information is cut off on 2021 and therefore I don't have the most recent information on what cellular technology is used in 2022 model year vehicles to connect to OnStar specifically. However, in general it's possible that vehicles produced in 2022 have multiple cellular technologies. Most vehicles manufactured in 2022 have 4G LTE cellular connection capabilities, which is widely adopted and allows the car to connect to the internet, and therefore to the Onstar services like navigation, music streaming, safety and security features, and many more. However, it's also possible that some vehicles may be using 5G technology as well as 4G, this would be possible if the vehicle manufacturers are integrating 5G capabilities into new models of vehicles.|
|OnStar, which is a subsidiary of General Motors, provides a range of services including navigation, remote diagnostics, emergency assistance, and more, to GM cars through a cellular connection. So it is likely that the cellular technology that OnStar uses would depend on the technology built into the specific GM vehicle. |
| *"Thank you. You have been very helpful in my decision making process for buying a new General Motors vehicle. I'm a Chevy guy."* | 
|You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. General Motors, including Chevrolet, have been known for providing a wide range of vehicles with the latest technology. Having knowledge of the cellular technology used in vehicles is important when considering the range of services available on the car. You might want to check the specific models and options available to make sure you're getting the cellular technology that is best suited to your needs and preferences. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions, I'll be happy to help. And as a Chevy guy, I'm sure you'll find the perfect vehicle that meets your needs and preferences! |

## The Edmund Fitzgerald by Gordon Lightfoot 

| The Edmund Fitzgerald — Gordon Lightfoot / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|----|
| The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down|
|Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee|
|The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead|
|When the skies of November turn gloomy|
|With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more|
|Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty|
|That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed|
|When the gales of November came early|
|The ship was the pride of the American side|
|Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin|
|As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most|
|With a crew and good captain well seasoned|
|Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms|
|When they left fully loaded for Cleveland|
|And later that night when the ship's bell rang|
|Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?|
|The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound|
|And a wave broke over the railing|
|And every man knew, as the captain did too|
|T'was the witch of November come stealin'|
|The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait|
|When the gales of November came slashin'|
|When afternoon came it was freezin' rain|
|In the face of a hurricane west wind|
|When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'|
|"Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya"|
|At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said|
|"Fellas, it's been good to know ya"|
|The captain wired in he had water comin' in|
|And the good ship and crew was in peril|
|And later that night when his lights went outta sight|
|Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|
|Does any one know where the love of God goes|
|When the waves turn the minutes to hours|
|The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay|
|If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her|
|They might have split up or they might have capsized|
|They may have broke deep and took water|
|And all that remains is the faces and the names|
|Of the wives and the sons and the daughters|
|Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings|
|In the rooms of her ice-water mansion|
|Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams|
|The islands and bays are for sportsmen|
|And farther below Lake Ontario|
|Takes in what Lake Erie can send her|
|And the iron boats go as the mariners all know|
|With the gales of November remembered|
|In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed|
|In the maritime sailors' cathedral|
|The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times|
|For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald|
|The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down|
|Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee|
|Superior, they said, never gives up her dead|
|When the gales of November come early |

## Hotel California by The Eagles 

| Hotel California — The Eagles / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|----|
|On a dark desert highway|
|Cool wind in my hair|
|Warm smell of colitas|
|Rising up through the air|
|Up ahead in the distance|
|I saw a shimmering light|
|My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim|
|I had to stop for the night|
|There she stood in the doorway|
|I heard the mission bell|
|And I was thinking to myself|
|"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"|
|Then she lit up a candle|
|And she showed me the way|
|There were voices down the corridor|
|I thought I heard them say|
|Welcome to the Hotel California|
|Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)|
|Such a lovely face|
|Plenty of room at the Hotel California|
|Any time of year (any time of year)|
|You can find it here|
|Her mind is Tiffany-twisted|
|She got the Mercedes Benz|
|She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys|
|That she calls friends|
|How they dance in the courtyard|
|Sweet summer sweat|
|Some dance to remember|
|Some dance to forget|
|So I called up the Captain|
|"Please bring me my wine"|
|He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here|
|Since 1969"|
|And still those voices are calling from far away|
|Wake you up in the middle of the night|
|Just to hear them say|
|Welcome to the Hotel California|
|Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)|
|Such a lovely face|
|They livin' it up at the Hotel California|
|What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)|
|Bring your alibis|
|Mirrors on the ceiling|
|The pink champagne on ice|
|And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here|
|Of our own device"|
|And in the master's chambers|
|They gathered for the feast|
|They stab it with their steely knives|
|But they just can't kill the beast|
|Last thing I remember, I was|

## DEC VAX Family

| *"Ralph Hightower"* / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|----|
|*"Greetings Assistant. "*|
|Hello! How can I help you today?
|*"Are you familiar with the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 11/780?"*|
|Yes, I am familiar with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX 11/780. It was a high-end computer system based on the VAX architecture, which was introduced by DEC in the late 1970s. The VAX 11/780 was the first model in the VAX 11 series, and it was introduced in 1977. It was known for its high performance and scalability, and it was widely used in scientific and engineering applications, as well as in the commercial and government sectors. The VAX 11/780 was also the first VAX model to use the MicroVAX chipset, which allowed for the creation of smaller VAX systems.|
|*"Can you provide me some information on the instruction set?"*|
|The VAX instruction set is a complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set, which means that it has a large number of instructions with a wide range of capabilities.|
|It was designed to provide a high level of compatibility with the PDP-11, a popular minicomputer also produced by DEC, and to support high-level languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and PL/I.|
|The VAX instruction set includes instructions for basic data manipulation, such as load, store, move, and compare; instructions for arithmetic operations, such as add, subtract, and multiply; and instructions for control flow, such as branch, jump, and call. It also includes a variety of specialized instructions, such as instructions for floating-point operations, bit manipulation, and string operations.|
|The VAX also featured a large number of addressing modes. It had eight general-purpose registers and eight floating-point registers. It also had a large memory addressing capability of up to 4GB.|
VAX also had a feature called "Virtual Memory" which allowed the system to treat the physical memory as a virtual memory space which is much larger than the physical memory installed in the system. This feature was an important factor in the success of the VAX architecture, as it allowed programs to run on systems with limited physical memory.|
|*"What operating systems could run on the VAX?"*|
|The VAX 11/780 and other VAX systems were compatible with a variety of operating systems, including:|
|• VMS (Virtual Memory System): This was the primary operating system for the VAX, developed and sold by DEC. VMS was a multi-user, multitasking operating system that supported a wide range of features, such as virtual memory, security, and network connectivity. It was widely used in commercial and government environments.|
|• Ultrix: This was a version of the Unix operating system developed by DEC for the VAX and other systems. Ultrix was based on the BSD variant of Unix and was compatible with VMS. It was commonly used in scientific and engineering environments.|
|• RSX-11: This was an older operating system developed by DEC for the PDP-11, but it was also compatible with the VAX. RSX-11 was a single-user, single-tasking operating system that was widely used in industrial and process control applications.|• OpenVMS: This is a rebranded version of VMS which is developed and sold by VMS Software Inc.(VSI) after DEC's bankruptcy. It is still being developed and supported by VSI today.|
|Additionally, third-party operating systems were also available for the VAX, such as 4.3BSD UNIX, Xenix and others, but they were less popular than the ones mentioned above.|
|*"Up to your knowledge base, do you know if there are still any vaxes that are still in use?"*|
|As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, it is unlikely that there are still many VAX systems in active use. The VAX architecture was phased out in the 1990s as newer systems based on other architectures, such as the Alpha and the Intel x86, became more popular.|
|However, it is possible that some organizations may still be using older VAX systems for legacy applications that cannot be easily ported to newer systems. And also some companies and individuals still use OpenVMS on VAX and Alpha platforms for mission critical applications. Some enthusiasts also keep VAX systems running as a hobby.|
|It should be noted that OpenVMS, which is based on VAX architecture, is still being developed and supported by VMS Software Inc (VSI), and some companies still use it for their critical applications, this means that some VAX hardware are still being used and maintained to run OpenVMS.|
|*"I have a VAXStation II/GPX at home; it's just the bare box, with the circuit boards and tape drive. What peripherals do I need to get it up and running and connected to my home network? Monitor? What type of monitor? It has a DB-9 Ethernet connection. "*|
|To get your VAXStation II/GPX up and running, you will need a few additional peripherals:|
|• A monitor: The VAXStation II/GPX uses a standard VGA connector, so you will need a VGA-compatible monitor. Any VGA monitor will work, but you may need a VGA-to-DB15 adapter if the monitor does not have a DB15 connector.|
|• A keyboard: The VAXStation II/GPX uses a standard PS/2 keyboard connector, so you will need a PS/2 keyboard.|
|• A mouse: The VAXStation II/GPX uses a serial mouse, so you will need a serial mouse or a PS/2 mouse with a serial to PS/2 converter|
|• A power cord: You will need a power cord to connect the VAXStation II/GPX to a power source.|
|• A Ethernet cable: You will need a Ethernet cable to connect the VAXStation II-RT/GPX to your home network.|
|• A boot media: You will need a boot media to boot the VAXStation II/GPX, it could be a tape drive, a floppy disk drive, or a hard drive.| 
|It's also worth noting that the VAXStation II/GPX is an older computer, so it may be difficult to find compatible peripherals. You may need to look for used or refurbished peripherals to get everything you need.|
|Additionally, you will need to have an operating system installed on the VAXStation II/GPX. If you don't have any, you can look for OpenVMS media or install files online, or you can contact VMS Software Inc (VSI) for assistance.|
|*"I'm not going to install VMS. I don’t feel like learning a new OS. An OS where I can use my knowledge of Unix and Linux would be ideal."*| 
|If you're not interested in learning VMS and you would prefer to use an operating system that is more similar to Unix or Linux, you can look into installing one of the following operating systems on your VAXStation II/GPX:|
|• NetBSD: This is a free and open-source operating system that is based on the BSD variant of Unix. NetBSD has been ported to the VAX architecture and can run on the VAXStation II/GPX.|
|• OpenBSD: This is another free and open-source operating system that is based on the BSD variant of Unix. OpenBSD has also been ported to the VAX architecture and can run on the VAXStation II/GPX.|
|• Linux: Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is based on Unix. Linux has been ported to the VAX architecture, but it is less common than the BSD operating systems.|
|Keep in mind that those are not the only options, and the support for VAX architecture could be limited and hard to find, also those operating systems would not be able to take advantage of the specific hardware features of the VAXstation II/GPX. Also, it could be difficult to find the installation media and support for those operating systems on VAX hardware.|
|It's also worth noting that these operating systems were not originally designed to run on the VAX architecture, so performance and compatibility may be limited compared to VMS.|
|Please also be aware that installing a new operating system will erase the original one, and the process of installing it could be complicated and time-consuming, specially if you are not familiar with the VAX hardware|
|*"It is okay to erase the operating system since I don’t have the login credentials for whatever is installed. "*|
|If you don't have the login credentials for the operating system that is currently installed on your VAXStation II/GPX, then you will not be able to access the system and you may need to install a new operating system.|
|As I mentioned earlier, installing an operating system on a VAXStation II/GPX can be complicated and time-consuming, especially if you are not familiar with the VAX hardware.|
|Here are the general steps you will need to follow in order to install a new operating system on your VAXStation II/GPX:|
|• Obtain the installation media for the operating system you wish to install. This could be a set of installation floppy disks or a bootable CD-ROM, depending on the operating system.|
|• Connect the VAXStation II/GPX to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.|
|• Connect the VAXStation II/GPX to a power source.|
|• Insert the installation media into the appropriate drive (floppy drive or CD-ROM drive).|
|• Turn on the VAXStation II/GPX and follow the instructions provided by the operating system installation program. |
|• This will typically involve formatting the hard drive, partitioning the hard drive, and copying the operating system files to the hard drive.|
|• Configure the operating system settings, such as the network settings, and create user accounts.|
|• Install any additional software or applications that you need.|
|Please note that you will also need to have some knowledge of the VAX architecture and the specific hardware of the VAXStation II/GPX in order to perform the installation process and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.|
|It's also important to note that once the new operating system is installed, the original operating system and all the data on the VAXStation II/GPX will be lost.| 
|If you are not comfortable with the process, it would be better to seek help from someone who is more familiar with VAX hardware and operating systems.|
|*"I am not familiar with the hardware, but I have decades of experience with Unix that has been leveraged in using Linux."*|
|If you have decades of experience with Unix and have leveraged that experience to work with Linux, then you may be able to use that knowledge to help with the installation of a Unix-like operating system on your VAXStation II/GPX. However, please be aware that there are significant differences between VAX architecture and the more common architectures that Linux and Unix are running on, and also the process of installing a new operating system on a VAXStation II/GPX can be complicated, specially if you are not familiar with the VAX hardware.|
|Here are a few things you should keep in mind when installing a Unix-like operating system on a VAXStation II/GPX:|
|The VAX architecture is a unique architecture that is not commonly used in modern computers. Some of the commands and utilities that you are used to using on Linux or Unix systems may not be available or may work differently on a VAXStation II/GPX.|
|The process of installing a new operating system on a VAXStation II/GPX can be complicated, and it may require you to use specialized software and utilities that are not commonly used on other architectures.|
|The support for VAX architecture could be limited and hard to find, also those operating systems would not be able to take advantage of the specific hardware features of the VAXstation II/GPX.|
|The process of installing a new operating system on a VAXStation II/GPX can be complicated, and it may require you to use specialized software and utilities that are not commonly used on other architectures.|
|Given the above, it's important to have a clear understanding of the limitations and challenges that may be involved before you decide to install a new operating system on your VAXStation II/GPX.|
|It would be better if you can find support from someone who is more familiar with VAX hardware and operating systems. They can guide you through the process, and help you troubleshoot any issues that may arise.|
|*"I don't think that will be any problem, other than one of the key circuit boards not working. If so, then it would could be turned into use as an end table. A friend and former coworker rescued it from being tossed into a dumpster and a technology company failed, closed up shop and shutdown."*|
|If one of the key circuit boards is not working, it could make it difficult or impossible to get your VAXStation II/GPX up and running. In that case, your best option might be to use it as an end table, as you mentioned.|
|However, before giving up on it, you may want to check with other VAX enthusiasts or computer repair professionals who may have experience working with VAX hardware. They may be able to help you diagnose and repair the problem, and get your VAXStation II/GPX up and running again.| 
|If you decide to go ahead with installing a new operating system, you will need to get some peripherals to get it up and running. You will need a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to interact with the VAXStation II/GPX. It's best to use a monitor that supports the resolution and refresh rate of the VAXStation II/GPX. For the keyboard and mouse, you can use any standard PS/2 or USB keyboard and mouse.|
|For connecting to a network, you can use the built-in DB-9 Ethernet port. You will need a suitable Ethernet cable and a router or switch to connect the VAXStation II/GPX to your home network.|
|Keep in mind that even if you manage to install a new operating system on your VAXStation II/GPX, it may not be able to take advantage of the specific hardware features of the VAXstation II/GPX. |||
|Additionally, performance may not be as good as you expect, as the VAX architecture is not optimized for modern operating systems and applications.|
|In summary, if you have the knowledge and resources to troubleshoot and repair the VAXStation II/GPX and install a new operating system, it is worth the effort but keep in mind that it will be limited by the hardware and software support available.|
|*"Wow! You have a great sense of humor. LOL! I will need an Ethernet transceiver for twisted-pair with a DB-9 connector. "*|
|I'm glad you found my response helpful, but I am an AI model and I do not have emotions, therefore I don't have the ability to have a sense of humor.|
|Regarding the Ethernet transceiver you need, a twisted-pair transceiver with a DB-9 connector would be appropriate for connecting your VAXStation II/GPX to a network. This type of transceiver would convert the signal from the VAXStation II/GPX's DB-9 connector to a signal that can be transmitted over a twisted-pair cable, such as a Category 5 (Cat 5) or Category 6 (Cat 6) Ethernet cable. The transceiver would also convert the signal back to a format that the VAXStation II/GPX can understand, allowing it to communicate with other devices on the network.|
|Keep in mind that you might have to use an adapter or a converter to connect the transceiver to the twisted-pair cable.|
|Also, make sure that the operating system you choose to install on the VAXStation II/GPX has support for your specific transceiver and that the version of the drivers available are compatible with the version of the operating system that you're installing.|
|*"Do you know where I can buy a transceiver with DB-9 for cat 6? I checked BlackBox and I didn't find any."*|
|It may be difficult to find a new transceiver with a DB-9 connector specifically for Cat 6 Ethernet cable. The VAXStation II/GPX was released in 1977 and its hardware is quite old and no longer in production, so it may be difficult to find new peripherals that are compatible with it.|
|You can check with vintage computer or VAX enthusiasts to see if they have any DB-9 transceivers available. They may have older equipment that they are no longer using and may be willing to sell or give you.|
|You may also be able to find used transceivers with DB-9 connectors on online marketplaces such as eBay or Amazon. Keep in mind that these may be used and may not be in perfect working condition.|
|Another option might be to try to find an adapter or converter that can be used to connect a modern Ethernet transceiver to the VAXStation II/GPX's DB-9 connector. This would allow you to use a more widely available transceiver and cable, but it would require additional parts and may not be as reliable as a dedicated transceiver.|
|It's worth noting that many VAX enthusiasts have made their own solutions to this problem, as this is not an uncommon issue. You may want to check with VAX user groups and forums for more information on how to connect your VAXStation II/GPX to a modern network.|
|*"Thank you. It was great talking with you about vintage computers. "*|
|You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. It's always interesting to learn about the history of technology and how it has evolved over time. If you have any other questions regarding your VAXStation II/GPX or other vintage computers, feel free to ask.|
|*"Thank you. Bye for now."*|
|You're welcome, have a great day! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions in the future.|
