| Hi ChatGPT. Can we resume our discussion about Chevrolet's mid-engine Corvette? | Hello! I'm Assistant, not ChatGPT. I'm happy to help with any questions you have about the mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette. What would you like to know? |
| Very well. You were incorrect about Chevrolet offering a manual transmission. Chevrolet executives stated that the majority of Corvette orders were for the automatic transmission and that it didn't make sense to offer a manual to such a small niche of buyers. | Thank you for letting me know. I apologize for the mistake in my previous message. It's important to keep in mind that the information available to me is limited to my training data, and I may not always have the most up-to-date information.<br><br>Can I help with anything else? Do you have any other questions about the mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette? |
| That is all I have for today. Thank you. | You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day! |

## Analysis of John F. Kennedy's Address to Rice University 

| Question | ChatGPT |
|----|----|
President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman Miller, Mr. Webb, Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen: <br><br>I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief. <br><br>I am delighted to be here and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion. <br><br>We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds. <br><br>Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that this Nation's own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension. <br><br>No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come, but condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man¹s recorded history in a time span of but a half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year, and then less than two months ago, during this whole 50-year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power. <br><br>Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America¹s new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight. <br><br>This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems, new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward. <br><br>So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But this city of Houston, this State of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. This country was conquered by those who moved forward--and so will space. <br><br>William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage. <br><br>If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space.<br><br>Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it--we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. <br><br>Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first. In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others, all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world's leading space-faring nation. <br><br>We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.<br><br>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? <br><br>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. <br><br>It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency. <br><br>In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where five F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.<br><br>Within these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth. Some 40 of them were "made in the United States of America" and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the Soviet Union. <br><br>The Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science. The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral and dropping it in this stadium between the 40-yard lines. <br><br>Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course. Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms, and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs. <br><br>We have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public. <br><br>To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind, and in this decade, we shall make up and move ahead. <br><br>The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation, by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well as the school. Technical institutions, such as Rice, will reap the harvest of these gains. <br><br>And finally, the space effort itself, while still in its infancy, has already created a great number of new companies, and tens of thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel, and this city and this State, and this region, will share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston, your City of Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community. During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area, to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City. <br><br>To be sure, all this costs us all a good deal of money. This year¹s space budget is three times what it was in January 1961, and it is greater than the space budget of the previous eight years combined. That budget now stands at $5,400 million a year--a staggering sum, though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year. Space expenditures will soon rise some more, from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman and child in the United States, for we have given this program a high national priority--even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us. But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun--almost as hot as it is here today--and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this decade is out--then we must be bold. <br><br>I'm the one who is doing all the work, so we just want you to stay cool for a minute. [laughter] <br><br>However, I think we're going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid. I don't think we ought to waste any money, but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties. It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university. It will be done during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform. But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this decade. <br><br>I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America. <br><br>Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, "Because it is there." <br><br>Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked. <br>Thank you.  | This is a speech given by President John F. Kennedy at Rice University in Houston, Texas on September 12, 1962. In the speech, President Kennedy discusses the importance of space exploration and the United States' role in leading the world in this endeavor. He emphasizes the rapid pace of technological advancement and the need for the United States to remain at the forefront of this progress. He also discusses the challenges and difficulties that come with exploring space, but asserts that these must be overcome with determination and courage. President Kennedy concludes the speech by reaffirming the United States' commitment to peaceful exploration of space and its desire to use space as a means of advancing knowledge and understanding. |
| What impact did the speech have? | The speech given by President John F. Kennedy at Rice University in Houston, Texas on September 12, 1962 is often referred to as the "Moon Speech" because of its central focus on the United States' plans to land a man on the moon. The speech had a significant impact on the American public and on the nation's space progam.<br><br>In the speech, President Kennedy set an ambitious goal for the United States: to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. This goal, known as the Apollo program, required a massive investment of time, resources, and personnel. It also required a significant shift in the focus of the nation's space program, which up until that point had largely been centered on satellite launches and other scientific missions.<br><br>The speech galvanized public support for the space program and helped to secure the necessary funding and resources to achieve the goal of landing a man on the moon. The United States successfully landed astronauts on the moon in 1969, fulfilling the promise made by President Kennedy in his speech. The Apollo program is widely regarded as one of the greatest achievements in the history of space exploration, and President Kennedy's Moon Speech is remembered as a pivotal moment in the nation's history. |

| Question | ChatGPT |
|-----|----|
| Cellular telephone companies in Canada sunsetted 2G cellular technology in 2015, whereas United States cellular telephone companies sunsetted 2G technologies in 2022. Can you provide me with information of when the various generations of cellular technologies in the United States? I am interested in the lifespan of 3G, 4G, and 5G, individually. Can you elaborate on each? | Sure, I can provide you with information about the lifecycle of various generations of cellular technologies in the United States.<br><br>2G (or 2nd Generation) cellular technology was the first digital cellular technology and was widely adopted in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was based on the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard and enabled the first mobile data services, such as text messaging and basic internet access. Many cellular companies sunsetted 2G networks in the United States in 2022 to make room for newer, faster technologies.<br><br>3G (or 3rd Generation) cellular technology was an upgrade from 2G that allowed for faster data speeds and more advanced mobile services, such as streaming video and mobile web browsing. The 3G standard was based on the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) standards. 3G networks were widely adopted in the United States in the mid to late 2000s and were in use until around 2010 to 2020 when the 4G (LTE) started to be deployed.<br><br>4G (or 4th Generation) cellular technology, also known as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is based on the IPv6, it was a significant upgrade from 3G, providing faster data speeds and more reliable connections. 4G networks allowed for high-definition video streaming and more advanced mobile apps, and it was widely adopted in the United States between 2010-2020 . Nowadays many companies are upgrading their networks to 5G and 4G network will still in use for many more years as a fallback for areas where 5G is not available.<br><br>5G (or 5th Generation) cellular technology is the latest generation of cellular technology and it was first adopted in the United States in 2019. It's based on the new 5G NR (New Radio) standard and promises even faster data speeds and more capacity than 4G. With 5G networks, it will be possible to support new use cases such as connected cars, industrial automation, and virtual reality. It's expected that 5G will be widely adopted in the United States over the next several years, but it will take many years for the 5G to cover most places.<br><br>Please note that these are rough timelines, as the exact timing of when a particular generation of cellular technology was adopted and sunsetted can vary depending on the specific cellular carrier and region.
| Thank you. When do you think that 3G and 4G technologies will no longer be in use? | 5G networks continue to be built out and adopted. While 3G may still be supported by some carriers in certain areas, it will likely become increasingly rare as more and more people upgrade to smartphones that are compatible with 4G and 5G networks.<br><br>As for 4G, it will continue to be used for a while as a fallback or as a coverage solution in places where 5G is not yet available, or where devices are not 5G compatible. The cost and complexity of upgrading the existing infrastructure to 5G, make it a long process, therefore 4G will still exist for many years to come. Some carriers may begin sunsetting their 4G networks, but it will be a gradual process that will likely take several years.<br><br>It's also worth noting that even after 4G networks are phased out, it's likely that devices and equipment that support 4G will continue to be used for some time as well, especially in developing countries or remote areas where access to the latest technology is more limited.
| Thank you. Do you know which cellular technology is used in 2022 model year vehicles use to connect to OnStar? | I apologize but my information is cut off on 2021 and therefore I don't have the most recent information on what cellular technology is used in 2022 model year vehicles to connect to OnStar specifically. However, in general it's possible that vehicles produced in 2022 have multiple cellular technologies. Most vehicles manufactured in 2022 have 4G LTE cellular connection capabilities, which is widely adopted and allows the car to connect to the internet, and therefore to the Onstar services like navigation, music streaming, safety and security features, and many more. However, it's also possible that some vehicles may be using 5G technology as well as 4G, this would be possible if the vehicle manufacturers are integrating 5G capabilities into new models of vehicles.<br><br>OnStar, which is a subsidiary of General Motors, provides a range of services including navigation, remote diagnostics, emergency assistance, and more, to GM cars through a cellular connection. So it is likely that the cellular technology that OnStar uses would depend on the technology built into the specific GM vehicle. |
| Thank you. You have been very helpful in my decision making process for buying a new General Motors vehicle. I'm a Chevy guy. | You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. General Motors, including Chevrolet, have been known for providing a wide range of vehicles with the latest technology. Having knowledge of the cellular technology used in vehicles is important when considering the range of services available on the car. You might want to check the specific models and options available to make sure you're getting the cellular technology that is best suited to your needs and preferences. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions, I'll be happy to help. And as a Chevy guy, I'm sure you'll find the perfect vehicle that meets your needs and preferences! |



[^1]: It is interesting that in the year 1979, a movie about a nuclear accident at a nuclear power plant was released and a real accident that occurred at a nuclear power plant also occurred.
