# Boss Hogg of Hampton County, Alex Murdaugh: The Crimes, and Victims, His Partners In Crime

## Victims

For generations, the Murdaugh family has ruled over the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit of South Carolina, encompassing the counties of Allendale, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton, and Jasper, meting out justice as if it were their personal fiefdom. This is the downfall of of disgraced and disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh to convicted felon.

## Scheduling

| Date/Event |

| **April 5, 2023** |
| **[Sources: Judge Clifton Newman Wants Prosecutors To Start Moving Murdaugh Cases](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/04/05/sources-judge-clifton-newman-wants-prosecutors-to-start-moving-murdaugh-cases/)** |
|South Carolina circuit court judge Clifton Newman is ready to schedule the next round of criminal trials tied to the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga – and is pushing prosecutors in the office of S.C. attorney general Alan Wilson to start moving these cases. In fact, the veteran judge is said to have raised scheduling concerns with assistant attorney general John Meadors following a bond hearing this week in Richland County, sources familiar with the conversation told this news outlet. Newman presided over the double homicide trial of convicted killer Alex Murdaugh earlier this year – winning near-universal acclaim for his adept and even-keeled handling of the Palmetto State’s ‘Trial of the Century.’ The soft-spoken 71-year-old from Kingstree, S.C. – whose daughter is also a circuit court judge – was tapped by S.C. chief justice Donald Beatty back in September 2021 with handling all Murdaugh-related court cases. He has shone in that role ever since, singlehandedly restoring some of the faith South Carolinians have lost in their notoriously uneven “justice” system.|
|Murdaugh, 54, was found guilty by a Colleton County grand jury on March 2, 2023 of killing his wife, 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the family’s hunting property. Judge Newman sentenced him to life in prison the following day.|
|In the immediate aftermath of the double homicide trial – which readers will recall was one dismissed juror away from a vastly different outcome – prosecutors indicated their next priority would be the pursuit of financial crimes tied to the 2018 death of Murdaugh family housekeeper Gloria Satterfield. Satterfield collapsed on the front steps of the main house on the Moselle property shortly before 9:24 a.m. EST on the morning of Friday, February 2, 2018. She died three weeks later. Alex Murdaugh convinced insurance investigators Satterfield was tripped by the family’s dogs – thus allowing him to fraudulently steer a multi-million dollar insurance settlement away from its intended recipients and into his own pockets. Murdaugh is facing twelve (12) criminal counts related to this alleged scheme including breach of trust, money laundering, computer crimes and obtaining property by false pretenses. His alleged collaborator in the scheme – attorney Cory Fleming of Beaufort, S.C. – is facing eighteen (18) similar criminal counts related to the scheme.|
|Both Murdaugh and Fleming are also facing a separate criminal conspiracy charge. Not only that, more charges could be forthcoming. As this news outlet reported last month, a statewide grand jury is continuing to investigate what remains of the Murdaugh empire – which ran the South Carolina Lowcountry like its own fiefdom for more than a century. During that time, the Hampton, S.C.-based “House of Murdaugh” enjoyed near-dictatorial power over a five-county region in the southernmost tip of South Carolina. Three generations of Murdaughs – including Alex’s late father, Randolph Murdaugh III – held the post of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor between 1920-2006. Murdaugh himself was a badge-carrying assistant solicitor.|
|Not surprisingly, there is also a public corruption component to this saga which could potentially involve several Murdaugh-friendly judges in the fourteenth circuit. Given the sheer number of known allegations – and the likelihood additional charges will be filed against other defendants tied to this saga – judge Newman’s sense of urgency is understandable. Unfortunately, as of the beginning of this week, no court dates had been set for any of the remaining Murdaugh-related cases according to Wilson spokesman Robert Kittle.|
|Let’s hope that changes soon …|

| **[Status Conference Scheduled For Alex Murdaugh’s First Financial Crimes Trial](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/04/20/status-conference-scheduled-on-alex-murdaughs-first-financial-crimes-trial/)** |
|Is convicted killer headed back to court? Or will prosecutors try one of his alleged co-conspirators?|
|The double homicide trial of convicted killer Alex Murdaugh ended nearly two months ago, but those closely following the broader ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga know South Carolina’s ‘Trial of the Century’ was just the first chapter of this still-unfolding narrative. |
|Murdaugh is also facing a myriad of other charges – including 99 counts of alleged financial crimes handed down by the South Carolina statewide grand jury and three local charges stemming from a September 2021 roadside shooting incident, the event that initiated his public unraveling. Prior to that unraveling, the Hampton, S.C.-based “House of Murdaugh” enjoyed near-dictatorial power over a five-county region in the southernmost tip of South Carolina. Three generations of Murdaughs – including Alex’s late father, Randolph Murdaugh III – held the post of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor between 1920-2006. Murdaugh himself was a badge-carrying assistant solicitor.|
|Last month, we reported that prosecutors in the office of South Carolina attorney general Alan Wilson were planning to advance the next chapter of this Southern Gothic drama, focusing their attention on more than thirty alleged financial crimes linked to the death of former Murdaugh housekeeper Gloria Satterfield. Details of this alleged criminal conspiracy can be found in a sprawling, 44-page indictment dated March 10, 2022. According to that document, Murdaugh and Beaufort-based attorney Cory Fleming engaged in an elaborate scheme between January 2019 and November 2020 to deprive Satterfield’s family of a multi-million dollar settlement following a fall that resulted in Satterfield’s death.|
|Satterfield collapsed on the front steps of main house at the Murdaughs’ Moselle property shortly before 9:24 a.m. EST on the morning of Friday, February 2, 2018. She died three weeks later, ostensible of complications from her fall. Alex Murdaugh convinced insurance investigators that Satterfield was tripped by the family’s dogs – thus allowing him to fraudulently steer a multi-million dollar insurance settlement away from its intended recipients and into his own pockets. Is that really what happened, though? Or did Murdaugh lie to insurance investigators the same way he lied to a Colleton County jury earlier this year?|
|Murdaugh is facing twelve (12) criminal counts related to the alleged Satterfield scheme including breach of trust, money laundering, computer crimes and obtaining property by false pretenses. Fleming is facing eighteen (18) similar criminal counts related to the scheme. Both Murdaugh and Fleming are also facing a separate criminal conspiracy charge.|
| *“Instead of compensating Gloria’s sons for her death, Murdaugh converted all of the money to his own personal use, for expenses including but not limited to utility payments, loan payments, a six-figure credit card payment, cash, and checks written to himself and associates, including six-figure checks written to his father and a law partner,”* the indictments alleged.|
|Should there have been a settlement in the first place, though?|
|Murdaugh has reportedly admitted to his attorneys that he knew his family’s dogs had nothing to do with Satterfield’s death – which could throw the entire settlement into jeopardy. In May 31, 2022 – six weeks prior to being indicted on murder charges – Murdaugh confessed judgment in the amount of $4.3 million in connection with a civil case brought by Satterfield family attorney Eric Bland. As of this writing, no date has been set for the Satterfield financial trial. However, deputy attorney general Creighton Waters – the lead prosecutor for the statewide grand jury – has told multiple parties those charges are next up in the vast Murdaugh criminal queue. The timing of all these cases could come into clearer focus this week as a status conference has been scheduled for 10:00 a.m. EDT this Friday (April 21, 2023) at the Hampton County courthouse in Hampton, S.C.|
|Circuit court judge Clifton Newman – who has been pushing prosecutors to start moving the remaining Murdaugh cases on the docket – will preside over the hearing.
One factor that could be delaying the movement of these cases is the legislative immunity afford to Murdaugh’s lead attorney, state senator Dick Harpootlian. For those of you unfamiliar with this controversial component of the Palmetto State’s “justice” system – a state lawmaker cannot be compelled to appear in a South Carolina courtroom anytime between January and July. That’s seven months of “legislative protection” afforded to these attorneys each and every year – during which cases involving their clients cannot be heard (unless they waive this privilege). To his credit, Harpootlian waived his legislative immunity during the six weeks Murdaugh stood trial in Walterboro, S.C. from January 23 through March 3 – missing a big chunk of the 2023 legislative session in the process.|
|Sources familiar with the ongoing discussions say prosecutors could move forward with the charges against Fleming in the event Harpootlian is unavailable to participate in a trial involving Murdaugh. In addition to Fleming, disgraced banker Russell Laffitte – who is appealing his recent federal conviction on various Murdaugh-related financial charges – is also facing numerous state charges tied to his dealings with Murdaugh. Then there is Curtis “Eddie” Smith – Murdaugh’s alleged drug dealer/ check casher and the man who allegedly shot Murdaugh in the head during the roadside shooting incident. Smith stands accused of four counts of money laundering, three counts of forgery, one count of conspiracy, one count of methamphetamine trafficking, one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and one count of simple possession of marijuana. He is also facing fraud and weapons charges tied to the roadside shooting on Old Salkehatchie Road – which took place almost three months after the graphic murders of Murdaugh’s wife and son.|
|While we keep tabs on all of these defendants and the various charges they are facing, it is important to bear in mind even more charges could be forthcoming – against Murdaugh and potentially other defendants. As this news outlet reported last month, a statewide grand jury is continuing to investigate what remains of this erstwhile empire.|
