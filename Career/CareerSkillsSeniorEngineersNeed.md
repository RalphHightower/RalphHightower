[^12]: There was one person at [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control](https://www.scdhec.gov/) who thought that she was *project manager extraordinaire*. With meetings that she called, she would enter the meeting room at the appointed time, and then burn ðŸ”¥ the next ten minutes futzing with her laptop ðŸ’», plugging it into the network, booting up her laptop, logging into the network, hooking up the projector, aligning the projector, looking for her PowerPoint file, and then, the meeting could begin. She had scheduled ðŸ“…  a one hour meeting that would end fifteen minutes after the close of business. For the first ten minutes, she had the on-site meeting participants crawling around on the floor looking for a live phone jack to start the conference call. However, I had to leave at **COB** to make it home on time to take one of our dogs to the veterinarian. I got up and walked out the door at 4:45 PM. She shouted **"You can't leave!**" I didn't respond. I asked my manager the next day about when the meeting ended. He said that it ended shortly after I left.
[^13]: Be prepared to start the meeting on time. Chairing the weekly Change Control Meetings rotated among the developers each month. The laptop used to review the week's submitted changes was ancient and slow. Ten minutes prior to the start of the 9 AM meeting, I would get the laptop and projector, go to the conference room, get the laptop booted, logged into the network, set up the projector, and log into the Change Control Meeting system for review, and call the conferencing number so all off-site meeting participants would be able to voice their approval, disapproval, or suggestion for improvements.
