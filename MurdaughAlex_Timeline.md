One of those individuals took advantage of his mental illness and agreed to take Alex's life, by shooting him in the head,”* the statement reads, noting Murdaugh is cooperating with the *“investigations into his shooting, opioid use and the search to find the person or people responsible for the murder of his wife and son.”* That same day, investigators reopened the investigation into the 2018 death of Murdaugh’s housekeeper, Satterfield, and her surviving sons filed a civil lawsuit against Alex Murdaugh, claiming he allegedly swindled them out of a $505,000 life insurance settlement. |

|Their $1.3 million settlement fund, which still could grow, includes money from the following sources: |
| About $300,000 from the liquidation of Murdaugh’s $1.7 million retirement plan. After taxes and early withdrawal penalties, nearly $900,000 remained. Roughly $600,000 of that was allocated to pay for Murdaugh’s criminal legal defense. |
|Nearly $360,000 from the July sale of the Edisto Beach house that Alex and Maggie Murdaugh jointly owned. The house went for $955,000 but a good chunk of that money was needed to satisfy the mortgage, an outstanding lien and real estate fees. |
| Nearly $515,000 from the sale of 146 acres of property in Berkeley County in which Murdaugh had an ownership stake. |

|*“Until now, this state has never had a prosecution in which millions of pages of documents purportedly supporting over eighty counts of various financial crimes allegedly committed by the defendant are declared to be, in some vague way ‘inextricably intertwined’ with murder charges against the same defendant,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote in the filing. *“If the defense must wait until trial to discover what (if anything) that means, the result will be an extension of (the) trial by weeks and continuances within the trial, while defense counsel review documents and make motions.”* The lawyers went on to note that this would *“risk introduction of testimony or evidence later deemed inadmissible, which in turn could create extended debate on curative jury instructions and, ultimately, avoidable appellate legislation.”*|
|*“It would be fundamentally unfair to allow the state to ambush Murdaugh at trial with a surprise theory about how some unproven non-violent prior bad act should be admitted as evidence he murdered his wife and son, while claiming the defense was given notice of the purported evidence just because the state dumped 1.2 million pages of documents of unknown relevance on the defense,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote. |

|*“The jury will need to understand the distinction between who Alex Murdaugh appeared to be to the outside world — a successful lawyer and scion of the most prominent family in the region — and who he was in the real life only he fully knew — an allegedly crooked lawyer and drug user who borrowed and stole whatever he could to stay afloat and one step ahead of detection,”* Waters wrote. *“Proof of years of Alex Murdaugh’s unbroken series of misappropriations, lies, loans, debts, and thefts is necessary to explain that distinction to a jury.”* For example, the filing states Murdaugh quickly offered law enforcement a potential motive for the slayings. Within 30 seconds of his first interview on the night of the killings, Murdaugh suggested *“the killer’s motive stemmed from the February 2019 boat wreck that resulted in the tragic death of Mallory Beach,”* the filing states. Waters wrote *“a series of bad land deal(s) exacerbated by the recession permanently changed his finances” and started Murdaugh down an “incessant financial roller coaster”* that ultimately turned him into a legal con artist.|
|The Beach family’s attorney in the boat crash lawsuit was seeking a court order to compel Murdaugh to disclose his bank records and assets, disclosures that would have revealed *“the true picture of Defendant’s finances and his years of alleged theft,”* Waters wrote. A hearing on that issue was set for June 10, 2021, three days after the murders. *“This case is unique in South Carolina history for many reasons,”* Waters wrote. *“One of those is that exposing what happened to Maggie and Paul necessarily has its roots in a corruption that began years ago and festered until June 7 was the result. The evidence should be admitted so the jury can fairly assess why a man might murder his wife and son.”* ||

|One Murdaugh in the Walterboro courtroom had helped build his family into a multigenerational legal dynasty that became synonymous with wealth, influence and law enforcement in the southern corner of South Carolina. The other had brought that legacy crashing down with a decade-long crime spree that came to light over the past year. That contrast won’t be on display much longer. Unprompted, Judge Clifton Newman announced at a Dec. 9 hearing that the painting of Buster Murdaugh Jr. would come down for the duration of his grandson’s Jan. 23 double murder trial, in which he stands accused of brutally killing his wife and son at the family’s spacious hunting estate. |

|In the indictment, venued in Hampton County, the State Grand Jury charged Alex Murdaugh with nine counts of Willful Attempt to Evade or Defeat a Tax. For tax years 2011-2019, Murdaugh failed to report $6,954,639 of income earned through illegal acts thereby causing state taxable income to be underreported to the State of South Carolina. Murdaugh owes state tax totaling $486,819. The crimes charged in the indictment carry the following classifications and penalties:|
|• Willful Attempt to Evade or Defeat a Tax is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and/or fine of up to $10,000 plus the cost of prosecutions|
Altogether, through 19 indictments containing 99 charges against Murdaugh, the State Grand Jury has indicted Murdaugh for schemes to defraud victims of $8,789,447.77 and $486,819 to the State of South Carolina.|

Accordingly, Waters asked Newman to *“give scientists time to assess the science”* before engaging in a debate over the viability of the evidence. *“We were looking for a needle in that terabyte haystack,”* Harpootlian said during the early December hearing.|

|*“Following nearly ten hours of deliberations, two jurors were improperly dismissed and replaced with alternates, only to have a newly constituted jury return a guilty verdict forty minutes later,”* Daniel and Austin wrote. *“One of those jurors requested removal based on her dissenting status, and the error in her removal constitutes a miscarriage of justice.”* The government has fired back against this assertion, claiming Gergel *“did not abuse (his) discretion by replacing two jurors.”* *“The record clearly demonstrates that the court, after inviting the parties’ input, appropriately exercised its discretion to empanel two alternate jurors to replace jurors who could no longer serve,”* a December 21 filing from prosecutors Emily Limehouse, Winston Holliday and Kathleen Stoughton noted.|

|*“The state is turning a blind eye to the obvious, that the reason Smith failed the polygraph when asked if he murdered Maggie and Paul is because he in fact did commit these heinous crimes,”* Murdaugh’s attorneys noted. *“Maggie had a thing going on with the groundskeeper which I never met him, don’t know his name … and Paul went down into one of the barns and caught him and he got upset and he went and got his rifle and was hollering and screaming his mama his mama was running and she fell down and she got up, he shot her in the ass and the bullet come out the top of her head and then he turned to the groundskeeper guy,”* Smith told the investigator. *“But the groundskeeper already went to his truck and got a shotgun.”* *“Eddie Smith was a common man now in an uncommon situation,”* Aimee Zmroczek, Smith’s lawyer, said. *“His lawyer, a man whose family he respected dragged him into this world to use him as a patsy.  One of the many fall guys Murdaugh is stepping on to try and keep his feet clean.  Eddie is a hard blue-collar worker and a people pleaser who now finds himself broken, stuck in jail, and the target for a crime he didn’t commit.”* |

| [‘Murdaugh Murders’ Saga: All About Motive](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/01/09/murdaugh-murders-saga-all-about-motive/)|
|*“This was a white collar case which culminated in two murders,”* Waters said. *“A slow burn, which was heating up and heating up until June 7, 2021.”*|
|Citing *“a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation,”* People claimed *“Maggie drove one hour from the family’s home into Charleston in late April to meet with a lawyer to explore her options about ending her marriage to Alex Murdaugh.”* *“What happened during that exploratory consultation is not known,”* the story continued, claiming Maggie *“had just begun to look into the family finances to determine the state of their marital assets.”*|
|The day after the article was published, representatives from Murdaugh’s camp released the following statement:|
|*“The most recent allegations by People magazine regarding the state of Maggie and Alex Murdaugh’s marriage are totally inconsistent with what we have been told by friends and family members,”* the statement noted. *“Also, we have reviewed many years of text messages on Alex’s phone, and the conversations between Alex and Maggie portray a very loving relationship. It is our hope that the media will continue to focus on covering the investigation of the person or people responsible for the murder of Maggie and Paul and not reporting salacious stories with no credible sources connected to the Murdaugh family.”* *“In the time the aftermath of the murders gave him, Defendants set about covering his tracks,” the filing alleged. *“He borrowed money to cover enough of the bypassed fees so that Chris Wilson could send them to (his law firm) as if they had been there all along.”*|
|The motion proceeds to offer a glimpse into how prosecutors plan on incorporating the bizarre roadside shooting involving Murdaugh that took place on September 4, 2021. According to the state, Murdaugh met that day with Chris Wilson on the front porch of his parent’s home in Almeda regarding the $192,000 portion of this fee that was still missing. Within hours of this meeting – *“as accountability started to fall upon Alex Murdaugh again, (he) suddenly became the ‘victim’ of a shooting on the side of the road on Old Salkahatchie.”* *“People initially rallied to his aid again,”* prosecutors noted. *“Only this time the facts came to light a lot quicker.”*|
|The admissibility of motive in a criminal trial can be complicated. Rule 404(b)[^5] of the S.C. Rules of Criminal Procedure states that, *“evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.”* *“It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent,”* the rule continued. Given the voluminous indictments filed against Murdaugh over the past year, both the defense and prosecution are aware that the admissibility of Murdaugh’s alleged prior bad acts is allowed will be a critical component of their case. On December 5, 2022, Harpootlian and Griffin filed a motion asking the office of attorney general Alan Wilson to *“file a bill of particulars stating the alleged motive it intends to present at trial.”* In this motion, Griffin and Harpootlian stated they were seeking this information to *“adequately prepare a defense and … avoid unnecessarily extending the trial by weeks.”* |

|Multiple Murdaugh defendants in line to be dismissed from civil case … In the settlement agreement, the personal representative for Maggie’s estate – Alex Murdaugh’s younger brother John Marvin Murdaugh – waived his right to any fees and agreed to pay the following:|
|• An estimated $290,000 in outstanding legal fees and administrative expenses|
|• $12,305.28 to be paid to John Marvin Murdaugh as personal representative to reimburse himself for funds he advanced on behalf of the estate|
|• $275,000 to be paid by the estate to satisfy a fraudulent conveyance claim made by the court appointed receivers regarding the transfer of the family’s Moselle property from Maggie’s estate back to Alex Murdaugh’s name.|
|• $6,511.52 to Laura Jones LLC to satisfy an outstanding creditor claim made against the estate|
|• $530,000 to Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, as sole devisee of the estate|
|• $100,000 to Attorney Joe McCulloch on behalf of Conner Cook, one of the boat crash victims.|
|The remaining balance of the estate – an undisclosed sum – will be transferred to Tinsley on behalf of Renee Beach as the representative of Mallory Beach, Morgan Doughty, and Miley Altman. Doughty and Altman were also passengers on the boat at the time of the crash. In addition to settling the lawsuits, the agreement resolves any creditor claims made against Maggie Murdaugh’s estate. Of interest? It is contingent upon a loan from Palmetto State Bank (PSB) being resolved, released, and satisfied for a payment of no more than $25,000 by the personal representative of the estate.|
| *“I am happy for everyone involved to have reached an agreement that – if approved – will result in the dismissal of Buster and Maggie’s estate from the case,”* Tinsley said. *“Court approval is one of the contingencies of the agreement and that happening, along with Palmetto State Bank’s agreement to abide by the deal it struck with the co-receivers. Hopefully, both those things will occur and we can then focus on concluding this matter with a trial at the earliest date possible. The settlement will leave Alex Murdaugh, Paul Murdaugh’s estate and Parker’s (convenience store) as the remaining defendants at trial.”* |

|This story is based on information unveiled at the federal trial of former Palmetto State Bank chief executive Russell Laffitte, at which 24 witnesses testified and more than 200 exhibits were admitted over three weeks. The Post and Courier obtained copies of the government’s evidence, including more than 11 years of Alex Murdaugh’s bank records, after seeking a court order for their release. Laffitte has challenged his conviction, arguing in part that jurors were replaced improperly after several hours of deliberations. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel has not yet ruled on his request for a new trial. Laffitte still faces 21 charges at the state level.|
|Alex Murdaugh was not called as a witness at Laffitte’s trial because he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Murdaugh faces dozens of state-level charges, including several in connection with the alleged diversion of money from Natarsha Thomas, Hakeem Pinckney and Arthur Badger. Murdaugh’s defense attorney Dick Harpootlian declined to answer questions for this article. |

|Walterboro launched a branding campaign, calling itself *“the front porch of the Lowcountry”* and scattering bright red rocking chairs around its three-block downtown. *“If they’re traveling to Edisto Beach, there’s a good bet they’re going to be coming through Walterboro,”* said the city manager, Jeff Molinari. *“So it just fits.”* *“We’re always looking for economic development,”* said Scott Grooms, Walterboro’s director of tourism and downtown development. He called the area *“gorgeous,”* with its 1822 courthouse, antebellum homes, and painted brick storefronts on a tree-lined main street — most of which were occupied by small businesses or co-ops selling crafts and consignments, but a few of which stood empty. *“We have to put on a good face.”* |
|One called having them at the trial tantamount to providing a picnic at a public hanging. Another said inviting them was sick, treating the trial like dinner and a show. But Grooms pushed back on any characterization of the food trucks as part of an entertainment package for the courtroom audience.  *“They won’t see Ferris wheels, bouncy houses and such,”* he said, gesturing to a lot near the Wildlife Center, the gateway to a preserved cypress wetland within the city limits. *“It is going to be basically a food court that is within walking distance to the trial.”* Grooms, a relentlessly cheerful man with a shock of white hair, worked in media before happily returning to his hometown of Walterboro, and he personally recalled how hard it was to get lunch during the Smith trial. The court usually breaks for only an hour, and Grooms worried that during the Murdaugh hearing Walterboro’s four downtown eateries will be overwhelmed. *“We expect to be flooded,”* he said. *“That courthouse holds 238, and so we expect to be full every day.”*  |
|*“I honestly didn’t even know the trial was upcoming. Somebody told me a couple of months ago,”* said Mandy Burdick, who explained she’d long been planning with her sister to start a venture called Colleton Coffee. Although they don’t have a timeline, they are trying to get the place up and running as soon as possible. *“There’s going to be so many people wanting a coffee shop kind of thing.”* *“People in Hampton County do not want to bring up that Murdaugh name,”* said Ritter, who just spent a year teaching school in Hampton. But in Walterboro, the feeling is different, she said. *“I don’t think anybody here is scared. I think they’re all interested in it.”* *“I mean, these people spent a lot of money while they were in town,”* Charles said of the Smith trial, which engendered an impromptu hotel, an ad hoc media center, and shows by Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue. *“And then afterwards, we still had tourists.”* Between reporters, protesters and gawkers, Grooms doesn’t know exactly how many people will descend on Walterboro, or for how long. But whoever they are, *“these people are going to become residents of Walterboro,”* he said. *“We’re just going to have to extend our neighborliness.”*

|The filing also blasted prosecutors and investigators for allegedly waging *“a campaign of selective and deceptive leaks to news media to convince the public that Murdaugh is guilty before he is tried.”* The most *“extraordinary leak?”* The assertion that high velocity impact spatter had been found on shirt worn by Murdaugh on the night of the murders – which was first reported by FITSNews last April. *“The only possibly motive for this leak was to convince the public that Murdaugh was guilty of the murders before trial, even before he was formally charged,”* Harpootlian and Griffin wrote. *“This leak was an extrajudicial statement made on behalf of the state with the deliberate intention to prejudice the present judicial proceedings.”* *“It was also a lie,”* they continued. Harpootlian and Griffin’s motion specifically seeks to *“prohibit the state from offering at trial any testimony regarding blood spatter from Tom Bevel … or other person whose opinion derives from review of Mr. Bevel’s work product.”* |

Simpson trial,”* Columbia lawyer Joe McCulloch said.  *“There is going to be a lot of brainpower in that courtroom,”* said Bryan Stirling, a Columbia attorney who serves as executive director of the state Department of Corrections. *“Is it going to be a fair fight?”* McCulloch asked. *“The courtroom will have good lawyers on both sides. But in the sense of experience, I believe it to be a mismatch.”* *“Dick is not the classic defense lawyer,”* said Jack Swerling, Harpootlian’s Clemson classmate and former law partner. *“Dick plays offense.”* *“That community may have their mind made up that something happened completely different than where the evidence goes,”* Strom said.  *“There’s a certain: ‘Don’t tell me how to think. Don’t tell me how to process stuff. Don’t look down on me’ that both the defense and the prosecution are going to have to be very wary of,”* Sellers said. |

|Shady legal maneuvering exposed …|
|In a memo supporting the appointment of a receiver filed on November 1, 2021 by Tinsley, the Beach family attorney argued that the two lawsuits *“confirm that Buster Murdaugh and Alex are continuing to dispose of assets and cancel significant debts with apparent preference for family members without regard to potential claims of others.”* *“Since March 2021, Alex Murdaugh’s family and friends have given him at least $550,000 which is unaccounted for,”* Tinsley noted in the memo. *“These facts raise questions of where Alex Murdaugh spent this additional $550,000 to whom he has given it, for what purposes, and was any benefit received in return.”* To his credit, Griffin told Parker *“FYI, Judge Hall had sent the attorneys an email that he was granting the order for a receiver and injunction.”* Parker replied minutes later saying *“I can’t believe (judge Hall) did that but don’t think it matters to (sic) much except Buster who is one of the worst victims.”* *“In a case fraught with moments that leave you speechless, this is a shocking turn of events,”* Tinsley said. *“Mr. Parker has taken a meritless position in his objection to a settlement that merely attempts to salvage what is left of Maggie’s estate and give some closure to those who so desperately need it.  Clearly he doesn’t have standing to make this objection. If his position as a lien holder of a secret, back room confessed judgment were so important to him, I’d think he would have done something to perfect a claim against Maggie’s estate. But he did not and it’s now too late for him to try and jump to the front of a line he was never in.”* |

|It showed that out of 68 prospective jurors who reported to Charleston’s federal courthouse, 28 stood when they were asked if they were familiar with the case — enough that U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel asked them to queue up for more detailed questioning. Their responses showed varying levels of exposure to the case. At one extreme, juror No. 23 said they’d watched several documentaries and followed podcasts like the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, as had juror No. 172. Both of them were dismissed; one was removed from consideration after Laffitte defense attorney Bart Daniel objected to their inclusion, saying *“the podcast scares the heck out of us” because he believed it conveyed “strong opinions of guilt.”*|
|*“I don’t want somebody who’s had their head in the sand. I wouldn’t want somebody who hasn’t heard about Murdaugh, because I want somebody who’s part of the world,”* Savage said. *“I don’t want the type of juror that would say they’d never heard of him, because that means they haven’t heard of anything else.”*|

### Personal Opinion 

Alex Murdaugh has lived a life of privileges and money. Although Alex Murdaugh is indicted for two charges in the murder of his wife and son, he should remain in prison for the remainder of his life. If he were to get the maximum sentence for his financial crimes, his sentence would be longer than his remaining expected lifespan.

## ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS (Post and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina)

On June 7, 2021, two members of South Carolina’s powerful Murdaugh family were gunned down at the family’s Colleton County hunting lodge in a grisly killing that attracted global attention.

Attorney Alex Murdaugh, who lost his wife and son in the shooting, has since been charged with their murders.

He has also been accused of staging a suicide plot, trafficking drugs and embezzling more than $8.7 million from clients and his former law firm.

It has been an epic downfall for the scion of a wealthy family that controlled the local prosecutor’s office for generations.

His downward spiral has ensnared a half-dozen alleged accomplices, spawned a web of criminal investigations and civil lawsuits and raised fresh questions about shortcomings in South Carolina’s justice and banking systems.
