Murdaugh’s lawyers released a statement to explain why their client allegedly conspired with Smith in the alleged suicide scheme. *“For the last 20 years, there have been many people feeding his addiction to opioids. During that time, these individuals took advantage of his addiction and his ability to pay substantial funds for illegal drugs. One of those individuals took advantage of his mental illness and agreed to take Alex's life, by shooting him in the head,”* the statement reads, noting Murdaugh is cooperating with the *“investigations into his shooting, opioid use and the search to find the person or people responsible for the murder of his wife and son.”* That same day, investigators reopened the investigation into the 2018 death of Murdaugh’s housekeeper, Satterfield, and her surviving sons filed a civil lawsuit against Alex Murdaugh, claiming he allegedly swindled them out of a $505,000 life insurance settlement. |

Also, we have reviewed many years of text messages on Alex’s phone, and the conversations between Alex and Maggie portray a very loving relationship.

## Personal Opinion 

Alex Murdaugh has lived a life of privileges and money. Although Alex Murdaugh is indicted for two charges in the murder of his wife and son, he should remain in prison for the remainder of his life. If he were to get the maximum sentence for his financial crimes, his sentence would be longer than his remaining expected lifespan.
