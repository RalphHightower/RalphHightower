### Personal Opinion 

Alex Murdaugh has lived a life of privileges and money. Although Alex Murdaugh is indicted for two charges in the murder of his wife and son, he should remain in prison for the remainder of his life. If he were to get the maximum sentence for his financial crimes, his sentence would be longer than his remaining expected lifespan.
